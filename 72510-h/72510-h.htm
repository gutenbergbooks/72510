<h2 class="nobreak">I. FOUR MORAL CAUSES</h2>
</div>

<h3>1<br>

<i>Birth Control</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE grotesque failure of the campaign to put
down propaganda for birth control in the
Republic has a lesson in it for those romantic
optimists who believe that in the long run, by some
mysterious hook or crook and perhaps with divine
help, Prohibition will be enforced. They will not
heed that lesson, but it is there nevertheless. Church
and state combine to baffle and exterminate the birth
controllers. They are threatened with penal servitude
and their customers are threatened with hell-fire.
Yet it must be obvious that they are making progress
in the land, for the national birth-rate continues to
slide downhill, steadily and rapidly.</p>

<p>Incidentally, it is amusing and instructive to observe
that it diminishes with greatest celerity among
the educated and highly respectable classes, which is
to say, among those who are ordinarily most law-abiding.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span> 
The same thing is to be noted when one
turns to Prohibition. The majority of professional
criminals, now as in the old days of sin, are teetotalers,
but when one comes to the good citizens who
scorn them and demand incessantly that the <i>Polizei</i>
butcher them and so have done with them, one comes
at once upon a high density of scofflaws. I know
many Americans of easy means, some of them greatly
respected and even eminent. Not two per cent make
any pretense of obeying the Volstead Act. And not
two per cent of their wives are innocent of birth control.
The reason is not far to seek. Both the Volstead
Act and the statute aimed at birth control invade
the sanctity of the domestic hearth. They take
the roof off a man’s house, and invite the world to look
in. Obviously, that looking in is unpleasant in proportion
as the man himself is dignified. If he is a
low fellow, he doesn’t care much, for he is used to
such snooping by his low neighbors. But if he is one
who has a high opinion of himself, and is accustomed
to seeing it ratified by others, then he is outraged.
And if he has any natural bellicosity in him and resistance
seems reasonably safe, he resists with great
diligence and vigor.</p>

<p>Here, perhaps, we come upon an explanation of
the fact that Prohibition and all other such devices
for making men good by force are far less opposed in
the country than they are in the cities. The yokel is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
trained from infancy to suffer espionage. He has
scarcely any privacy at all. His neighbors know
everything that is to be known about him, including
what he eats and what he feeds his quadrupedal colleagues.
His religious ideas are matters of public
discussion; if he is recusant the village pastor prays
for him by name. When his wife begins the sublime
biological process of giving him an heir, the news
flies around. If he inherits $200 from an uncle in
Idaho everyone knows it instantly. If he skins his
shin, or buys a new plow, or sees a ghost, or takes a
bath it is a public event. Thus living like a goldfish
in a glass globe, he acquires a large tolerance of
snoutery, for if he resisted it his neighbors would set
him down as an enemy of their happiness, and probably
burn his barn. When an official spy or two are
added to the volunteer pack he scarcely notices it. It
seems natural and inevitable to him that everyone outside
his house should be interested in what goes on inside,
and that this interest should be accompanied by
definite notions as to what is nice and what is not
nice, supported by pressure. So he submits to governmental
tyranny as he submits to the village inquisition,
and when he hears that city men resist, it
only confirms his general feeling that they are scoundrels.
They are scoundrels because they have a
better time than he has—the sempiternal human reason.
The city man is differently trained. He is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
used to being let alone. Save when he lives in the
slums, his neighbors show no interest in him. He
would regard it as outrageous for them to have
opinions about what goes on within the four walls of
his house. If they offered him advice he would invite
them to go to hell; if they tried force he would
bawl for the police. So he is doubly affronted when
the police themselves stalk in. And he resists them
with every means at his command, and believes it is
his high duty to do so, that liberty may not perish
from the earth.</p>

<p>The birth control fanatics profit by this elemental
fact. It is their great good fortune that their enemies
have tried to put them down, not by refuting their
ideas, but by seeking to shove them into jail. What
they argue for, at bottom, remains very dubious, and
multitudes of quite honest and intelligent persons are
against it. They have by no means proved that a
high birth-rate is dangerous, and they have certainly
not shown that they know of any sure and safe way
to reduce it—that is, any way not already known to
every corner druggist. But when an attempt is made
to put them down by law, the question whether they
are wise falls into the background, and the question
whether their rights are invaded comes forward. At
once the crowd on their side is immensely reinforced.
It now includes not only all the persons who believe
in birth control, but also all the persons who believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
in free ideas and free speech, and this second group,
it quickly appears, is far larger than the first one,
and far more formidable. So the birth controllers
suddenly find themselves supported by heavy battalions,
and that support is sufficient to make them
almost invulnerable. Personally, I am inclined to
be against them. I believe that the ignorant should
be permitted to spawn <i>ad libitum</i>, that there may be
a steady supply of slaves, and that those of us who
are more prudent and sanitary may be relieved of
unpleasant work. If the debate were open and fair,
I’d oppose the birth controllers with all the subtlest
devices of rhetoric, including bogus statistics and
billingsgate. But so long as they are denied their
plain rights—and, in particular, so long as those
rights are denied them by an evil combination of
theologians and politicians,—I am for them, and
shall remain so until the last galoot’s ashore. They
have got many more allies on the same terms. And
I believe that they are winning.</p>

<p>The law which forbids them to send their brummagem
tracts through the mails is obviously disingenuous
and oppressive. It is a part of the notorious
Postal Act, put on the books by Comstock himself,
executed by bureaucratic numskulls, and supported
by every variety of witch-burner. I know of no
intelligent man or woman who is in favor of the principal
of such grotesque legislation; even the worst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
enemies of the birth controllers would not venture to
argue that it should be applied generally. The way
to dispose of such laws is to flout them and make a
mock of them. The theory that they can be got rid of
by enforcing them is nonsense. Enforcing them
simply inspires the sadists who advocate them to
fresh excesses. Worse, it accustoms the people to
oppression, and so tends to make them bear it uncomplainingly.
Wherever, in the United States, there
has been any sincere effort to enforce Prohibition, the
anti-evolutionists are already on the warpath, and the
Lord’s Day Alliance is drumming up recruits. No,
the way to deal with such laws is to defy them, and
thus make them ridiculous. This is being done in the
case of the Volstead Act by millions of patriots, clerical
and lay. It is being done in the case of the Comstock
Act by a small band, but one full of praiseworthy
resolution.</p>

<p>Thus I deliver myself of a whoop for the birth
controllers, and pass on to pleasanter concerns. Their
specific Great Cause, it seems to me, is full of holes.
They draw extremely questionable conclusions from
a highly dubious body of so-called facts. But they
are profoundly right at bottom. They are right when
they argue that anyone who tries to silence them by
force is the common enemy of all of us. And they
are right when they hold that the best way to get rid
of such opposition is to thumb the nose at it.</p>

<h3>2<br>

<i>Comstockery</i></h3>

<p>In 1873, when the late Anthony Comstock began his
great Christian work, the American flapper, or, as
she was then called, the young lady, read <i>Godey’s
Ladies’ Book</i>. To-day she reads—but if you want
to find out what she reads simply take a look at the
cheap fiction magazines which rise mountain-high
from every news-stand. It is an amusing and at the
same time highly instructive commentary upon the
effectiveness of moral legislation. The net result of
fifty years of Comstockery is complete and ignominious
failure. All its gaudy raids and alarms have
simply gone for naught.</p>

<p>Comstock, of course, was an imbecile; his sayings
and doings were of such sort that they inevitably
excited the public mirth, and so injured the cause he
labored for. But it would be inaccurate, I believe,
to put all the blame for its failure upon his imbecility.
His successor, in New York, John S. Sumner, is by no
means another such unwitting comedian; on the contrary,
he shows discretion and even a certain wistful
dignity. Nevertheless, he has failed just as miserably.
When he took office “Three Weeks” was still
regarded as a very salacious book. The wives of
Babbitts read it in the kitchen, with the blinds down;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
it was hidden under every pillow in every finishing-school
in the land. To-day “Three Weeks” is dismissed
as intolerably banal by school-girls of thirteen.
To make a genuine sensation it is not sufficient
that a new book be naughty; it must be downright
pathological.</p>

<p>I have been reviewing current American fiction
pretty steadily since 1908. The change that I note is
immense. When I began, a new novel dealing frankly
with the physiology and pathology of sex was still
something of a novelty. It was, indeed, so rare that
I always called attention to it. To-day it is a commonplace.
The surprise now comes when a new
novel turns out to be chemically pure. Try to imagine
an American publisher, in these days, getting
alarmed about Dreiser’s “Sister Carrie” and suppressing
it before publication! The oldest and most
dignified houses would print it without question;
they print far worse every day. Yet in 1900 it
seemed so lewd and lascivious that the publisher who
put it into type got into a panic of fright, and hid the
whole edition in the cellar. To-day that same publisher
is advertising a new edition of Walt Whitman’s
“Leaves of Grass,” with “A Woman Waits for Me”
printed in full!</p>

<p>What ruined the cause of the Comstocks, I believe,
was the campaign of their brethren of sex hygiene.
The whole Comstockian case, as good Anthony himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
used to explain frankly, was grounded upon the
doctrine that virtue and ignorance were identical—that
the slightest knowledge of sin was fatal to virtue.
Comstock believed and argued that the only way to
keep girls pure was to forbid them to think about
sex at all. He expounded that doctrine often and
at great length. No woman, he was convinced, could
be trusted. The instant she was allowed to peek
over the fence she was off to the Bad Lands. This
notion he supported with many texts from Holy Writ,
chiefly from the Old Testament. He was a Puritan
of the old school, and had no belief whatever in virtue
<i>per se</i>. A good woman, to him, was simply one who
was efficiently policed. Unfortunately for him, there
rose up, within the bounds of his own sect, a school
of uplifters who began to merchant quite contrary
ideas. They believed that sin was often caused by
ignorance—that many a virtuous girl was undone
simply because she didn’t know what she was doing.
These uplifters held that unchastity was not the product
of a congenital tendency to it in the female, but
of the sinister enterprise of the male, flowing out of
his superior knowledge and sophistication. So they
set out to spread the enlightenment. If all girls of
sixteen, they argued not unplausibly, knew as much
about the dreadful consequences of sin as the average
police lieutenant or midwife, there would be no more
seductions, and in accordance with that theory, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
began printing books describing the discomforts of
parturition and the terminal symptoms of lues. These
books they broadcasted in numerous and immense
editions. Comstock, of course, was bitterly against
the scheme. He had no faith in the solemn warnings;
he saw only the new and startling frankness, and he
believed firmly that its one effect would be to “arouse
a libidinous passion ... in the mind of a modest
woman.” But he was spiked and hamstrung by the
impeccable respectability of the sex hygienists. Most
of them were Puritans like himself; some were towering
giants of Christian rectitude. One of the most
active, the Rev. Dr. Sylvanus Stall, was a clergyman
of the first chop—a sorcerer who had notoriously
saved thousands of immortal souls. To raid such
men, to cast them into jail and denounce them as
scoundrels, was palpably impossible. Comstock fretted
and fumed, but the thing got beyond him. Of
Pastor Stall’s books alone, millions were sold. Others
were almost as successful; the country was flooded
from coast to coast.</p>

<p>Whether Comstock was right or wrong I don’t know—that
is, whether these sex hygiene books increased
or diminished loose living in the Republic I don’t
know. Some say one thing and some another. But
this I <i>do</i> know; they had a quick and tremendous influence
upon the content of American fiction. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
old-time novel what are now called the Facts of Life
were glossed over mellifluously, and no one complained
about it, for the great majority of fiction
readers, being young and female, had no notion of
what they were missing. But after they had read the
sex hygiene books they began to observe that what
was set out in novels was very evasive, and that much
of it was downright untrue. So they began to murmur,
to snicker, to boo. One by one the old-time
novelists went on the shelf. I could make up a long
and melancholy roll of them. Their sales dropped
off; they began to be laughed at. In place of them
rose a new school, and its aim was to tell it all. With
this new school Comstock and his heirs have been
wrestling ever since, and with steadily increasing
bad fortune. Every year they make raids, perform
in the newspapers and predict the end of the world,
but every year the average is worse than the worst of
the year before. As a practicing reviewer, I have got
so used to lewd and lascivious books that I no longer
notice them. They pour in from all directions.
The most virtuous lady novelists write things that
would have made a bartender blush to death two decades
ago. If I open a new novel and find nothing
about Freudian suppressions in it, I suspect at once
that it is simply a reprint of some forgotten novel of
1885, with a new name. When I began reviewing I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
used to send my review copies, after I had sweated
through them, to the Y. M. C. A. Now I send them
to a medical college.</p>

<p>The Comstocks labor against this stream gallantly,
but, it seems to me, very ineptly. They can’t, of
course, proceed against every naughty book that comes
out, for there are far too many, but they could at
least choose their marks far more sagaciously than
they do. Instead of tackling the books that are
frankly pornographic and have no other excuse for
being, they almost always tackle books that have
obvious literary merit, and are thus relatively easily
defended. In consequence, they lose most of their
cases. They lost with “Jurgen,” they lost with “The
‘Genius,’” they lost with “Mlle. de Maupin,” and
they have lost countless other times. And every time
they lose they grow more impotent and absurd. Why
do they pick out such books? Simply because raiding
them gets more publicity than raiding more obscure
stuff. The Comstock Society, like all other
such pious organizations, is chronically short of
money, and the way to raise it is to make a noise in
the newspapers. A raid on “Night Life in Chicago,”
or “Confessions of an Escaped Nun” would get but
a few lines; an attack on “Jurgen” is first-page
stuff for days on end. Christian virtuosi, their
libido aroused, send in their money, and so the society
is saved. But when the trial is called and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
case is lost, contributions fall off again, and another
conspicuous victim must be found.</p>

<p>Well, what is the Comstocks’ own remedy for this
difficulty? It is to be found in what they call the
Clean Books Bill. The aim of this bill is to make it
impossible for a publisher accused of publishing an
immoral book to make any defense at all. If it ever
becomes a law the Comstocks will be able to pick
out a single sentence from a Dreiser novel of 10,000
pages and base their whole case upon it; the author
and publisher will be forbidden to offer the rest of
the book as evidence that the whole has no pornographic
purpose. Under such a law anyone printing
or selling the Bible will run dreadful risks. One
typographical error of a stimulating character will
suffice to send a publisher to jail. But will the law
actually achieve its purpose? I doubt it. Such extravagant
and palpably unjust statutes never accomplish
anything. Juries revolt against them; even
judges punch holes in them. The Volstead Act is
an excellent specimen. Has it made the Republic
dry?</p>

<h3>3<br>

<i>Capital Punishment</i></h3>

<p>Having argued against the death penalty with great
heat and eloquence for more than twenty years, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
hope I do not go beyond my rights when I now announce
that I have begun to wobble, and feel a strong
temptation to take the other side. My doubts, in all
seriousness, I ascribe to the arguments of the current
abolitionists. The more earnestly they set forth those
arguments, the more I am harassed by suspicions
that they are full of folly. A humane and Christian
spirit, to be sure, is in them; but is there any
sense? As I hint, I begin to doubt it. Consider
the two that are oftenest heard:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. That hanging a man (or doing him to death in any
other such coldblooded way) is a dreadful business, degrading
to those who have to do it and revolting to those
who have to witness it.</p>

<p>2. That it is useless, for it does not deter others from the
same crime.</p>
</div>

<p>The first of these arguments, it seems to me, is
plainly too weak to need serious refutation. All
it says, in brief, is that the work of the hangman is
unpleasant. Granted. But suppose it is? It may
be quite necessary to society for all that. There are,
indeed, many other jobs that are unpleasant, and
yet no one thinks of abolishing them. I pass over
those connected with surgery, obstetrics, plumbing,
military science, journalism and the sacred office,
and point to one which, like that of the hangman,
has to do with the execution of the laws: to wit, the
post of Federal judge under Prohibition. Consider<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
what a judge executing the Volstead Act must do
nearly every day. He must assume that men whom
he esteems and loves, men of his own profession,
even his fellow judges—in brief, the great body of
wet and enlightened Christian men—are all criminals.
And he must assume that a pack of spies
and blackmailers whose mere presence, in private
life, would gag him—in brief, the corps of Anti-Saloon
League snouters and Prohibition agents—are
truth-seekers and altruists. These assumptions
are obviously hard to make. Not a few judges, unable
to make them, resign from the bench; at
least one has committed suicide. But the remaining
judges, so long as they sit, must make them as in duty
bound, whatever the outrage to their feelings. Many
grow callous and suffer no more. So with the hangman,
and his even more disagreeable offices. A man
of delicate sensibilities, confronting them, would die
of horror, but there is no evidence that they are
revolting to the men who actually discharge them.
I have known hangmen, indeed, who delighted in
their art, and practiced it proudly. I have never
heard of one who threw up his job.</p>

<p>In the second argument of the abolitionists there
is more force, but even here, I believe, the ground
under them is very shaky. Their fundamental error
consists in assuming that the whole aim of punishing
criminals is to deter other (potential) criminals—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
we hang or electrocute A simply in order to so
alarm B that he will not kill C. This, I believe, is an
assumption almost as inaccurate as those which must
be made by a Federal judge. It confuses a part with
the whole. Deterrence, obviously, is <i>one</i> of the aims
of punishment, but it is surely not the only one. On
the contrary, there are at least half a dozen, and
some of them are probably quite as important. At
least one of them, practically considered, is <i>more</i>
important. Commonly, it is described as revenge,
but revenge is really not the word for it. I borrow
a better term from the late Aristotle: <i>katharsis</i>.
<i>Katharsis</i>, so used, means a salubrious discharge of
emotions, a healthy letting off of steam. A schoolboy,
disliking his teacher, deposits a tack upon the
pedagogical chair; the teacher jumps and the boy
laughs. This is <i>katharsis</i>. A bootlegger, paying
off a Prohibition agent, gives him a counterfeit $10
bill; the agent, dropping it in the collection plate
on Sunday, is arrested and jailed. This is also
<i>katharsis</i>. A subscriber to a newspaper, observing
his name spelled incorrectly in the report of a lodge
meeting, spreads a report that the editor of the paper
did not buy Liberty Bonds. This again is <i>katharsis</i>.</p>

<p>What I contend is that one of the prime objects
of judicial punishments is to afford this grateful
<i>katharsis</i> (a) to the immediate victims of the criminal
punished, and (b) to the general body of moral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
and timorous men. These persons, and particularly
the first group, are concerned only indirectly with
deterring other criminals. The thing they crave
primarily is the satisfaction of seeing the criminal
before them suffer as he made them suffer. What
they want is the peace of mind that goes with the
feeling that accounts are squared. Until they get
that satisfaction they are in a state of emotional
tension, and hence unhappy. The instant they get
it they are comfortable. I do not argue that this
yearning is noble; I simply argue that it is almost
universal among human beings. In the face of injuries
that are unimportant and can be borne without
damage it may yield to higher impulses; that is
to say, it may yield to what is called Christian
charity. But it never so yields when the injury
is serious, and gives substantial permanent satisfaction
to the person inflicting it. Here Christianity
is adjourned, and even saints reach for their sidearms.
The better the Christian, in fact, the more
violent his demand for <i>katharsis</i>—once he has unloaded
the Beatitudes. At the time of the Leopold-Loeb
trial in Chicago the evangelical pastors of the
town bawled for blood unanimously, and even a
Catholic priest joined them. On lower levels, it is
plainly asking too much of human nature to expect
it to conquer so natural an impulse. A keeps a
store and has a bookkeeper, B. B steals $700, invests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
it in Texas oil stocks, and is cleaned out. What
is A to do? Let B go? If he does so he will be
unable to sleep at night. The sense of injury, of
injustice, will keep him awake. So he turns B over
to the police, and they send him to prison. Thereafter
A can sleep. More, he has pleasant dreams.
He pictures B chained to the wall of a dungeon a
hundred feet underground, devoured by rats. It is
so agreeable that it makes him forget his $700. He
has got his <i>katharsis</i>.</p>

<p>The same thing precisely takes place on a larger
scale when there is a crime which destroys a whole
community’s feeling of security. Every law-abiding
citizen feels menaced and frustrated until the criminals
have been struck down—until the communal
capacity to get even with them, and more than even,
has been dramatically demonstrated. Here the business
of deterring others is no more than an afterthought.
The main thing is to destroy the scoundrels
whose act has alarmed everyone, and thus made
everyone unhappy. Until they are brought to book
that unhappiness continues; when the law has been
executed upon them there is a sigh of relief. In
other words, there is <i>katharsis</i>.</p>

<p>There is no public demand for the death penalty
for ordinary crimes, even for ordinary homicides.
Its infliction, say, for necking, for playing poker or
for bootlegging would shock all men of normal decency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
of feeling—that is to say, practically all men
save the evangelical clergy and their lay catchpolls.
But for crimes involving the deliberate and inexcusable
taking of human life, by men openly defiant
of all civilized order—for such crimes it seems, to
nine men out of ten, a just and proper punishment.
Any lesser punishment leaves them feeling that the
criminal has got the better of society—that he can
add insult to injury by laughing. That feeling is
intensely unpleasant, and no wonder! It can be
dissipated only by a recourse to <i>katharsis</i>, the invention
of the aforesaid Aristotle. That <i>katharsis</i> is
most effectively and economically achieved, as human
nature now is, by wafting the criminal to realms of
bliss.</p>

<h3>4<br>

<i>War</i></h3>

<p>My mail is flooded with the briefs and broadsides
of pacifist organizations, damning war as a curse
and those who make it as scoundrels. Such literature
I always read attentively, for it is full of racy
satire against the military, a class of men inevitably
more or less ludicrous in time of peace. But does
it convert me to the pacifist cause, which, as the pacifists
contend, is the cause of God? I can only report
simply that it does not. I read it, enjoy it, pass it
on to my pastor—and go on believing in war myself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
War is the only sport, so far as I know, that is
genuinely amusing. And it is the only sport that has
any intelligible use.</p>

<p>The arguments that are brought against it are
chiefly arguments, not against the thing itself, but
only against its political accompaniments and consequences,
most of them transient and gratuitous.
They reached a high tide of obnoxiousness, revolting
to all self-respecting men, during the last great moral
combat. That combat was carried on, at least from
this side of the fence, in a grossly hysterical, disingenuous,
cowardly and sordid manner. The high
participating parties were vastly alarmed by the foe,
and insanely eager to keep business going as usual,
and even better than usual. The result was that the
thing began as a sort of Methodist revival and ended
as a raid on a gentleman’s winecellar, with the Prohibition
agents fighting among themselves for the
best jugs. The richest of them, once peace came,
began sending the others extortionate bills for the
brass-knuckles, Bibles and jimmies that all had used
in common, and the heroes serving this usurer began
demanding tips in cash. But all that swinishness,
I submit, had no necessary connection with war itself.
It is perfectly possible to conduct war in a gallant and
honorable manner, and without using it as a mere
cloak to rob noncombatants. More, the thing has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
been done, and many times in the history of the
world. If it has been seldom done by democratic
nations, then blame democracy, not war. In democratic
nations everything noble and of good account
tends to decay and smell badly.</p>

<p>War itself, in its pure form, is something quite
different. It is a combat of men who believe that
a short and adventurous life, full of changing scenes
and high hazards, is better than a safe and dull one—in
other words, that it is better to have lived magnificently
than to have lived long. In this doctrine
I am unable to discern anything properly describable
as fallacy. If you argue that, assuming every man
to embrace it, the human race would come to an end,
I reply at once that you assume something wholly
impossible. And if you argue that the life of a warrior
is not actually magnificent, then I report that
the warrior should be permitted to judge of that himself.
Against all such arguments lie the plain facts
that the great races of the world have always been
more or less warlike, and that war has attracted the
talent and satisfied the aspiration of some of their
best men. I do not speak of antiquity alone; I speak
of our own time. The English, the Germans and
the French are all warlike, to-day as always—and if
you took away the English, the Germans and the
French <i>Homo sapiens</i> would be shorn of his stomach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
his liver and his ductless glands. If war is immoral,
then these great races are all immoral, and so are
their greatest men. The pacifists, of course, do not
shrink from that absurd argument. But the more
they maintain it the more it becomes evident that,
as logicians, they are on all fours with the Prohibitionists.</p>

<p>War, so conducted by warriors, is a superb business
and full of high uses. It makes for resolution,
endurance, enterprise, courage. It puts down the
sordid yearnings of ignoble men. Does it, incidentally,
shed some blood? Does it cost lives? The
pacifists, discussing those lives, always enmesh themselves
in the theory that, without war, they would go
on forever. It is, I believe, not so. War, at worst,
shortens them somewhat. But at the same stroke it
speeds up their tempo. The net result is simply a
matter of bookkeeping. A man killed at thirty,
after six months of war, has lived far longer than
a man dead of a bellyache at sixty, after forty-five
years on an office stool.</p>

<p>But I am not on my legs to-day to sing the charms
and glories of war; my purpose is to argue that,
whether glorious or not, it will remain inevitable on
this sad mud-pie so long as the great races of men
retain the view of it that I have described, and to
deduce therefrom the doctrine that pacifism, as a
scheme of practical politics, is thus not only unsound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
but also very dangerous. All that it could conceivably
accomplish, imagining it to succeed anywhere,
would be to make the nation embracing it highly
vulnerable—in brief, a sort of boozy idealist or unarmored
butter-and-egg man, roaming the world unprotected,
and so holding out irresistible temptations
to less moral and more realistic nations.</p>

<p>War, under the sorry scheme that now passes for
civilization, has been degraded—transiently only, I
hope and believe—to the uses of robbery. Whoever
has gold must have an army to guard it, or resign himself
to losing it. Especially must he have a guard
for it if his public repute is that of one with a not too
fine understanding of the difference between <i>meum</i>
and <i>tuum</i>. Such a reputation, it must be manifest, is
precisely that of the United States to-day. The rest of
the world is so passionately convinced that it is a thief
that robbing it would take on the high virtue and
dignity of a constabulary act. It is not robbed because
it is strong. It will not be robbed until it
grows weak.</p>

<p>But armed strength, argue the pacifists, does not
prevent war: it causes it. Who, reading history,
could believe in such transparent nonsense? Let us
turn to the late enemy. What kept the peace in
Europe for forty-four years if it was not the mighty
German army? If it had been weak, France would
have struck in 1875, and again in 1882, and again in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
1887, and again every two years thereafter. It took
nearly half a century to roll up a force sufficient
to tackle the colossus, and it took four years to
bring it down even then. Our own history is full
of examples to the same effect. In 1867 Napoleon
III, believing that the United States was war weary
and its army disbanded, prepared to move into
Mexico and tear the Monroe Doctrine to tatters. He
overlooked the large forces engaged in burning barns,
robbing hen-roosts and raiding cellars in the late
Confederacy. When General Sheridan marched
upon the Rio Grande at the head of this army of
heroes, Napoleon changed his mind. Three years
later he was disposed of by the Germans, and the Continent
settled down to forty-four years of peace.</p>

<p>Consider, again, the Venezuela episode. When
President Cleveland sent his message to Congress on
December 17, 1895, war with England became imminent
overnight. What prevented it? Was it the
fact that the United States had no army worthy of the
name? Or the fact that the United States had a
brand-new, highly effective and immensely pugnacious
navy, notoriously eager to try its guns?
Come, now, to 1898. Of all the nations of Europe,
only England sided with us against Spain. The Germans,
at Manila, went to great lengths to show their
hostility. Did they refrain from attacking Dewey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
because his fleet was smaller and weaker than theirs,
or because it was larger and stronger?</p>

<p>I could multiply instances, but observe the timekeeper
reaching for the gong. So far as I know,
there is no record in history of a nation that ever
gained anything valuable by being unable to defend
itself. Such nations, true enough, have sometimes
managed to exist for a time—but at what cost!
There is the case of Denmark to-day. It is discussing
disbanding its army on the ground that any
probable or even possible foe could dispose of that
army in five days. But what does this mean? It
means that the Danes must reconcile themselves to
living by the sheer grace of their stronger neighbors—that
they must be willing, when the time comes, to
see their country made a battle-ground by those neighbors,
and without raising a hand. Here I do not indulge
in idle talk: I am quoting almost literally a
member of the Danish cabinet.</p>

<p>I can’t imagine the people of a truly great nation
submitting to any such ignominious destiny. The
Danes have been forced into acquiescence by their
weakness. But why should the United States invite
the same fate by putting off its strength?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II. FOUR MAKERS OF TALES</h2>
</div>

<h3>1<br>

<i>Conrad</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">SOME time ago I put in a blue afternoon re-reading
Joseph Conrad’s “Youth.” A <i>blue</i>
afternoon? What nonsense! The touch of
the man is like the touch of Schubert. One approaches
him in various and unhappy moods: depressed,
dubious, despairing; one leaves him in
the clear, yellow sunshine that Nietzsche found in
Bizet’s music. But here again the phrase is inept.
Sunshine suggests the imbecile, barnyard joy of the
human kohlrabi—the official optimism of a steadily
delighted and increasingly insane Republic. What
the enigmatical Pole has to offer is something quite
different. If its parallel is to be found in music,
it is not in Schubert, but in Beethoven—perhaps even
more accurately in Johann Sebastian Bach. It is the
joy, not of mere satisfaction, but of understanding—the
profound but surely not merry delight which goes
with the comprehension of a fundamental fact—above
all, of a fact that has been coy and elusive. Certainly
the order of the world that Conrad sets forth with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
such diabolical eloquence and plausibility is no banal
moral order, no childish sequence of virtuous causes
and edifying effects. Rather it has an atheistic and
even demoniacal smack: to the earnest Bible student
it must be more than a little disconcerting. The God
he visualizes is no loving papa in a house-coat and
carpet-slippers, inculcating the great principles of
Christian ethics by applying occasional strokes
<i>a posteriori</i>. What he sees is something quite different:
an extremely ingenious and humorous Improvisatore
and Comedian, with a dab of red on His nose and
maybe somewhat the worse for drink—a furious and
far from amiable banjoist upon the human spine, and
rattler of human bones. Kurtz, in “Youth,” makes
a capital banjo for that exalted and cynical talent.
And the music that issues forth—what a superb
<i>Hexentanz</i> it is!</p>

<p>One of the curiosities of critical stupidity is the
doctrine that Conrad is without humor. No doubt it
flows out of a more general error; to wit, the assumption
that tragedy is always pathetic, that death itself
is inevitably a gloomy business. That error, I suppose,
will persist in the world until some extraordinary
astute mime conceives the plan of playing “King
Lear” as a farce—I mean deliberately. That it <i>is</i>
a farce seems to me quite as obvious as the fact
that “Romeo and Juliet” is another, this time lamentably
coarse. To adopt the contrary theory—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
view it as a great moral and spiritual spectacle,
capable of purging and uplifting the psyche like
marriage to a red-haired widow or a month in the
trenches—to toy with such notions is to borrow the
critical standards of a party of old ladies weeping
over the damnation of the heathen. In point of fact,
death, like love, is intrinsically farcical—a solemn
kicking of a brick under a plug-hat—, and most other
human agonies, once they transcend the physical—<i>i.
e.</i>, the unescapably real—have far more of irony
in them than of pathos. Looking back upon them
after they have eased one seldom shivers: one smiles—perhaps
sourly but nevertheless spontaneously.
This, at all events, is the notion that seems to me
implicit in every line of Conrad. I give you “Heart
of Darkness” as the archetype of his whole work and
the keystone of his metaphysical system. Here we
have all imaginable human hopes and aspirations
reduced to one common denominator of folly and
failure, and here we have a play of humor that is
infinitely mordant and searching. Turn to pages 136
and 137 of the American edition—the story is in the
volume called “Youth”—: the burial of the helmsman.
Turn then to 178-184: Marlow’s last interview
with Kurtz’s intended. The farce mounts by
slow stages to dizzy and breath-taking heights. One
hears harsh roars of cosmic laughter, vast splutterings
of transcendental mirth, echoing and reëchoing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
down the black corridors of empty space. The
curtain descends at last upon a wild dance in a
dissecting-room. The mutilated dead rise up and
jig....</p>

<p>It is curious, re-reading a thrice-familiar story,
how often one finds surprises in it. I have been
amazed, toward the close of “The End of the Tether,”
to discover that the <i>Fair Maid</i> was wrecked, not by
the deliberate act of Captain Whalley, but by the
machination of the unspeakable Massy. How is one
to account for so preposterous an error? Certainly
I thought I knew “The End of the Tether” as well as
I knew anything in this world—and yet there was
that incredible misunderstanding of it, lodged firmly
in my mind. Perhaps there is criticism of a sort
in my blunder: it may be a fact that the old skipper
willed the thing himself—that his willing it is visible
in all that goes before—that Conrad, in introducing
Massy’s puerile infamy at the end, made some
sacrifice of inner veracity to the exigencies of what,
at bottom, is somewhat too neat and well-made a tale.
The story, in fact, belongs to the author’s earlier manner;
I guess that it was written before “Youth” and
surely before “Heart of Darkness.” But for all that,
its proportions remain truly colossal. It is one of
the most magnificent narratives, long or short, old or
new, in the English language, and with “Youth” and
“Heart of Darkness” it makes up what is probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
the best book of imaginative writing that the English
literature of the Twentieth Century can yet show.
Conrad learned a great deal after he wrote it, true
enough. In “Lord Jim,” in “Victory,” and, above
all, in a “A Personal Record,” there are momentary
illuminations, blinding flashes of brilliance that he
was incapable of in those days of experiment; but no
other book of his seems to me to hold so steadily to so
high a general level—none other, as a whole, is more
satisfying and more marvelous. There is in “Heart
of Darkness” a perfection of design which one encounters
only rarely and miraculously in prose fiction:
it belongs rather to music. I can’t imagine taking
a single sentence out of that stupendous tale without
leaving a visible gap; it is as thoroughly <i>durch componiert</i>
as a fugue. And I can’t imagine adding anything
to it, even so little as a word, without doing
it damage. As it stands it is austerely and beautifully
perfect, just as the slow movement of the Unfinished
Symphony is perfect.</p>

<p>I observe of late a tendency to examine the English
of Conrad rather biliously. This folly is cultivated
chiefly in England, where, I suppose, chauvinistic
motives enter into the matter. It is the just boast
of great empires that they draw in talents from
near and far, exhausting the little nations to augment
their own puissance; it is their misfortune that these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
talents often remain defectively assimilated. Conrad
remained the Slav to the end. The people of his
tales, whatever he calls them, are always as much
Slavs as he is; the language in which he describes
them retains a sharp, exotic flavor. But to say that
this flavor constitutes a blemish is to say something
so preposterous that only schoolmasters and their
dupes may be thought of as giving it credit. The
truly first-rate writer is not one who uses the language
as such dolts demand that it be used; he is one who
reworks it in spite of their prohibitions. It is his
distinction that he thinks in a manner different from
the thinking of ordinary men; that he is free from
that slavery to embalmed ideas which makes them
so respectable and so dull. Obviously, he cannot
translate his notions into terms of everyday without
doing violence to their inner integrity; as well ask
a Richard Strauss to funnel all his music into the
chaste jugs of Prof. Dr. Jadassohn. What Conrad
brought into English literature was a new concept of
the relations between fact and fact, idea and idea,
and what he contributed to the complex and difficult
art of writing English was a new way of putting
words together. His style now amazes and irritates
pedants because it does not roll along in the old ruts.
Well, it is precisely that rolling along in the old ruts
that he tried to avoid—and it was precisely that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
avoidance which made him what he is. What lies
under most of his alleged sins seems to me to be simple
enough: he views English logically and analytically,
and not through a haze of senseless traditions and
arbitrary taboos. No Oxford mincing is in him.
If he cannot find his phrase above the salt, he seeks
it below. His English, in a word, is innocent. And
if, at times, there gets into it a color that is strange
and even bizarre, then the fact is something to rejoice
over, for a living language is like a man suffering
incessantly from small internal hemorrhages, and what
it needs above all else is constant transfusions of new
blood from other tongues. The day the gates go up,
that day it begins to die.</p>

<p>A very great man, this Mr. Conrad. As yet, I
believe decidedly underestimated, even by many of
his post-mortem advocates. Most of his first acclaimers
mistook him for a mere romantic—a talented
but somewhat uncouth follower of the Stevenson tradition,
with the orthodox cutlass exchanged for a Malay
<i>kris</i>. Later on he began to be heard of as a linguistic
and vocational marvel: it was astonishing that any
man bred to Polish should write English at all, and
more astonishing that a country gentleman from the
Ukraine should hold a master’s certificate in the
British merchant marine. Such banal attitudes are
now archaic, but I suspect that they have been largely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
responsible for the slowness with which his fame has
spread in the world. At all events, he is vastly less
read and esteemed in foreign parts than he ought to
be, and very few Continental Europeans have risen
to any genuine comprehension of his stature. When
one reflects that the Nobel Prize was given to such
third-raters as Benavente, Heidenstam, Gjellerup and
Tagore, with Conrad passed over, one begins to grasp
the depth and density of the ignorance prevailing in
the world, even among the relatively enlightened.
One “Lord Jim,” as human document and as work of
art, is worth all the works produced by all the Benaventes
and Gjellerups since the time of Rameses II.
It is, indeed, an indecency of criticism to speak of
such unlike things in the same breath: as well talk
of Brahms in terms of Mendelssohn. Nor is “Lord
Jim” a chance masterpiece, an isolated peak. On
the contrary, it is but one unit in a long series of
extraordinary and almost incomparable works—a
series sprung suddenly and overwhelmingly into full
dignity with “Almayer’s Folly.” I challenge the
nobility and gentry of Christendom to point to another
Opus 1 as magnificently planned and turned out as
“Almayer’s Folly.” The more one studies it, the
more it seems miraculous. If it is not a work of
absolute genius then no work of absolute genius exists
on this earth.</p>

<h3>2<br>

<i>Hergesheimer</i></h3>

<p>This gentleman, like Conrad, has been slated
very waspishly because his English is sometimes
in contempt of Lindley Murray. Once, a few years
back, a grammarian writing in the <i>New Republic</i>
formally excommunicated him for it. A number
of his offending locutions were cited, all of them,
it must be admitted, instantly recognizable as
pathological and against God by any suburban
schoolma’m. <i>Soit!</i> The plain truth is that Hergesheimer,
when it comes to the ultimate delicacies of
English grammar, is an ignoramus, as he is when
it comes to the niceties of Swedenborgian theology.
I doubt that he could tell a noun in the nominative
case from a noun in the objective. But neither could
any other man who writes as well as he does. Such
esoteric knowledge is the exclusive possession of grammarians,
whose pride in it runs in direct ratio to its
inaccuracy, unimportance and imbecility. English
grammar as a science thus takes its place with phrenology
and the New Thought: the more a grammarian
knows of it, the less he is worth listening to. Mastering
such blowsy nonsense is one thing, and writing
sound English is quite another thing, and the two
achievements seem to be impossible to the same man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
As Anatole France once remarked, nearly all first-rate
writers write “bad French”—or “bad English.”
Joseph Conrad did. France himself did. Dreiser
does. Henry James did. Dickens did. Shakespeare
did. Thus Hergesheimer need not repine.
He is sinful, but in good company. He writes
English that is “bad,” but also English that is
curiously musical, fluent, chromatic, various and
caressing. There is in even the worst of his
<i>Saturday Evening Post</i> novelettes for Main Street a
fine feeling for the inner savor of words—a keen ear
for their subtler and more fragile harmonies. In
“Cytherea,” which I like beyond all his works—even
beyond “The Three Black Pennys” and “Java Head”—they
are handled in so adept and ingenious a way,
with so much delicacy and originality, that it is no
wonder they offer an intolerable affront to pedagogues.</p>

<p>This novel, as I say, seems to me to be the best
that Hergesheimer has yet done. His best writing
is in it, and his best observation. What interests
him fundamentally is the conflict between the natural
impulses of men and women and the conventions of the
society that they are parts of. The struggles he depicts
are not between heroes and villains, dukes and
peasants, patriots and spies, but between the desire to
be happy and the desire to be respected. It is,
perhaps, a tribute to the sly humor of God that whichever
way the battle goes, the result is bound to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
disastrous to the man himself. If, seeking happiness
in a world that is jealous of it and so frowns upon it,
he sacrifices the good will of his fellow men, he always
finds in the end that happiness is not happiness
at all without it. And if, grabbing the other horn of
the dilemma, he sacrifices the free play of his instincts
to the respect of those fellow men, he finds that
he has also sacrificed his respect for himself. Hergesheimer
is no seer. He does not presume to solve
the problem; he merely states it with agreeable variations
and in the light of a compassionate irony. In
“Cytherea” it takes the ancient form of the sexual
triangle—old material, but here treated, despite the
underlying skepticism, with a new illumination.
What we are asked to observe is a marriage in which
all the customary causes follow instead of precede
their customary effects. To the eye of the world,
and even, perhaps, to the eye of the secondary figures
in it, the Randon-Grove affair is no more than a
standard-model adultery, orthodox in its origin and
in its course. Lee Randon, with an amiable and
faithful wife, Fanny, at home in Eastlake, Pa., in the
Country-Club Belt, with two charming children at
her knee, goes to the hell-hole known as New York,
falls in love with the sinister Mrs. Savina Grove, and
forthwith bolts with her to Cuba, there to encounter a
just retribution in the form of her grotesque death.
But that is precisely what does <i>not</i> happen—that is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
interiorly. Savina actually has little more to do with
the flight of Randon than the Pullman Company
which hauls him southward. It is already inevitable
when he leaves Eastlake for New York, almost unaware
of her existence. Its springs are to be sought
in the very normalcy that it so profoundly outrages.
He is the victim, like Fanny, his wife, of a marriage
that has turned upon and devoured itself.</p>

<p>Hergesheimer was never more convincing than in
his anatomizing of this <i>débâcle</i>. He is too impatient,
and perhaps too fine an artist, to do it in the conventional
realistic manner of piling up small detail. Instead
he launches into it with a bold sagittal section,
and at once the play of forces becomes comprehensible.
What ails Randon, in brief, is that he has
a wife who is a shade too good. Beautiful, dutiful,
amiable, virtuous, yes. But not provocative enough—not
sufficiently the lady of scarlet in the chemise of
snowy white. Worse, a touch of stupid blindness is
in her: she can see the honest business man, but she
can’t see the romantic lurking within him. When
Randon, at a country-club dance, sits out a hoe-down
with some flashy houri on the stairs, all that Fanny
can see in it is a vulgar matter, like kissing a
chambermaid behind the door. Even when Randon
brings home the doll, Cytherea, and gives it a place
of honor in their house, and begins mooning over
it strangely, she is unable to account for the business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
in any terms save those of transient silliness.
The truth is that Cytherea is to Randon what La
Belle Ettarre is to Cabell’s Felix Kennaston—his
altar-flame in a dun world, his visualization of the
unattainable, his symbol of what might have been.
In her presence he communes secretly with the outlaw
hidden beneath the chairman of executive committees,
the gypsy concealed in the sound Americano. One
day, bent upon God’s work (specifically, upon breaking
up a nefarious affair between a neighboring Rotarian
and a moving-picture lady), he encounters the
aforesaid Savina Grove, accidentally brushes her
patella with his own, get an incandescent glare in return,
discovers to his horror that she is the living
image of Cytherea—and ten days later is aboard the
Key West Express with her, bound for San Cristobal
de la Habaña, and the fires eternal.</p>

<p>A matter, fundamentally, of coincidence. Savina,
too, has her Cytherea, though not projected into a
doll. She too has toiled up the long slope of a flabby
marriage, and come at last to the high crags where
the air is thin, and a sudden giddiness may be looked
for. To call the thing a love-affair, in the ordinary
sense, is rather fantastic; its very endearments are
forced and mawkish. What Randon wants is not
more love, but an escape from the bonds and penalties
of love—a leap into pure adventure. And
what Savina wants, as she very frankly confesses, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the same thing. If a concrete lover must go with it,
then that lover must be everything that the decorous
William Loyd Grove is not—violent, exigent, savage,
inordinate, even a bit gross. I doubt that Savina
gets her wish any more than Randon gets his. Good
business men make but indifferent Grand Turks, even
when they are in revolt: it is the tragedy of Western
civilization. And there is no deliverance from the
bonds of habit and appearance, even with a mistress.
Ten days after he reaches Havana, Randon is almost
as securely married as he was at Eastlake. Worse,
Eastlake itself reaches out its long arm and begins
to punish him, and Savina with him. The conventions
of Christendom, alas, are not to be spat upon.
Far back in the Cuban hinterland, in a squalid little
sugar town, it is a photograph of Fanny that gives a
final touch of gruesomeness to the drama of Randon
and Savina. There, overtaken in her sin by that
banal likeness of the enemy she has never seen, she
dies her preposterous death. An ending profoundly
ironical. A curtain that gives a final touch of
macabre humor to a tale that, from first to last, is full
of the spirit of high comedy. Hergesheimer never
devised one more sardonically amusing, and he never
told one with greater skill.</p>

<p>The reviewers, contemplating it, were shocked by
his hedonism in trivialities—his unctuous manner of
recording the flavor of a drink, the sheen of a fabric,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the set of a skirt, the furnishings of a room. In all
that, I suppose, they saw something Babylonish, and
against the Constitution. But this hedonism is really
as essential a part of Hergesheimer as moral purpose
is part of a Puritan. He looks upon the world, not
as a trial of virtue, but as a beautiful experience—in
part, indeed, as a downright voluptuous experience.
If it is elevating to the soul to observe the fine colors
of a sunset, then why is it not quite as elevating to observe
the fine colors of a woman’s hair, the silk of her
frock, a piece of old mahogany, a Jack Rose cocktail?
Here it is not actually Hergesheimer’s delight in
beauty that gives offense, but his inability to differentiate
between the beauty that is also the good and the
true, and the beauty that is simply beauty. As for
me, I incline to go with him in his heresy. It constitutes
a valuable antidote to the moral obsession which
still hangs over American letters, despite the collapse
of the Puritan <i>Kultur</i>. It still seems a bit foreign and
bizarre, but that is because we have yet to achieve a
complete emancipation from the International Sunday-school
Lessons. In “Cytherea,” as in “Java Head,”
it gives a warm and exotic glow to the narrative.
That narrative is always recounted, not by a moralist,
but by an artist. He knows how to give an episode
color and reality by the artful use of words and the
images that they bring up—how to manage the tempo,
the play of light, the surrounding harmonies. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
investiture is always as much a part of his story as his
tale itself. So is his English style, so abhorrent to
grammarians. When he writes a sentence that is a
bit artificial and complex, it is because he is describing
something that is itself a bit artificial and complex.
When he varies his rhythms suddenly and
sharply, it is not because he is unable to write in the
monotonous sing-song of a rhetoric professor, but because
he doesn’t want to write that way. Whatever
such a man writes is <i>ipso facto</i> good English. It is
not for pedagogues to criticise it, but to try to comprehend
it and teach it. The delusion to the contrary is
the cause of much folly.</p>

<h3>3<br>

<i>Lardner</i></h3>

<p>A few years ago a young college professor, eager
to make a name for himself, brought out a laborious
“critical” edition of “Sam Slick,” by Judge Thomas
C. Haliburton, eighty-seven years after its first publication.
It turned out to be quite unreadable—a
dreadful series of archaic jocosities about varieties
of <i>Homo americanus</i> long perished and forgotten, in
a dialect now intelligible only to paleophilologists.
Sometimes I have a fear that the same fate awaits
Ring Lardner. The professors of his own day, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
course, are quite unaware of him, save perhaps as a
low zany to be enjoyed behind the door. They would
no more venture to whoop him up publicly and officially
than their predecessors of 1880 would have
ventured to whoop up Mark Twain, or their remoter
predecessors of 1837 would have dared to say anything
for Haliburton. In such matters the academic
mind, being chiefly animated by a fear of sneers,
works very slowly. So slowly, indeed, does it work
that it usually works too late. By the time Mark
Twain got into the text-books for sophomores two-thirds
of his compositions, as the Young Intellectuals
say, had already begun to date; by the time Haliburton
was served up as a sandwich between introduction
and notes he was already dead. As I say, I suspect
sadly that Lardner is doomed to go the same route.
His stories, it seems to me, are superbly adroit and
amusing; no other contemporary American, sober or
gay, writes better. But I doubt that they last: our
grandchildren will wonder what they are about. It is
not only, or even mainly, that the dialect that fills them
will pass, though that fact is obviously a serious
handicap in itself. It is principally that the people
they depict will pass, that Lardner’s Low Down
Americans—his incomparable baseball players, pugs,
song-writers, Elks, small-town Rotarians and golf
caddies—are flitting figures of a transient civilization
and doomed to be as puzzling and soporific, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
the year 2000, as Haliburton’s Yankee clock peddler
is to-day.</p>

<p>The fact—if I may assume it to be a fact—is certain
not to be set against Lardner’s account; on the
contrary, it is, in its way, highly complimentary to
him. For he has deliberately applied himself, not
to the anatomizing of the general human soul, but to
the meticulous histological study of a few salient individuals
of his time and nation, and he has done it
with such subtle and penetrating skill that one must
belong to his time and nation to follow him. I doubt
that anyone who is not familiar with professional
ball players, intimately and at first hand, will ever
comprehend the full merit of the amazing sketches in
“You Know Me, Al”; I doubt that anyone who has
not given close and deliberate attention to the
American vulgate will ever realize how magnificently
Lardner handles it. He has had more imitators, I
suppose, than any other living American writer, but
has he any actual rivals? If so, I have yet to hear of
them. They all try to write the speech of the streets
as adeptly and as amusingly as he writes it, and they
all fall short of him; the next best is miles and miles
behind him. And they are all inferior in observation,
in sense of character, in shrewdness and insight. His
studies, to be sure, are never very profound; he
makes no attempt to get at the primary springs of
human motive; all his people share the same amiable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
stupidity, the same transparent vanity, the same shallow
swinishness; they are all human Fords in bad repair,
and alike at bottom. But if he thus confines
himself to the surface, it yet remains a fact that his
investigations on that surface are extraordinarily
alert, ingenious and brilliant—that the character he
finally sets before us, however roughly articulated as
to bones, is so astoundingly realistic as to epidermis
that the effect is indistinguishable from that of life
itself. The old man in “The Golden Honeymoon”
is not merely well done; he is perfect. And so is
the girl in “Some Like Them Cold.” And so, even,
is the idiotic Frank X. Farrell in “Alibi Ike”—an
extravagant grotesque and yet quite real from glabella
to calcaneus.</p>

<p>Lardner knows more about the management of the
short story than all of its professors. His stories are
built very carefully, and yet they seem to be wholly
spontaneous, and even formless. He has grasped
the primary fact that no conceivable ingenuity can
save a story that fails to show a recognizable and interesting
character; he knows that a good character
sketch is always a good story, no matter what its
structure. Perhaps he gets less attention than he
ought to get, even among the anti-academic critics,
because his people are all lowly boors. For your
reviewer of books, like every other sort of American,
is always vastly impressed by fashionable pretensions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
He belongs to the white collar class of labor,
and shares its prejudices. He praises F. Scott Fitzgerald’s
stories of country-club flappers eloquently,
and overlooks Fitzgerald’s other stories, most of
which are much better. He can’t rid himself of the
feeling that Edith Wharton, whose people have
butlers, is a better novelist than Willa Cather, whose
people, in the main, dine in their kitchens. He lingers
under the spell of Henry James, whose most
humble character, at any rate of the later years, was
at least an Englishman, and hence superior. Lardner,
so to speak, hits such critics under the belt.
He not only fills his stories with people who read the
tabloids, say “Shake hands with my friend,” and buy
diamond rings on the instalment plan; he also shows
them having a good time in the world, and quite
devoid of inferiority complexes. They amuse him
sardonically, but he does not pity them. A fatal
error! The moron, perhaps, has a place in fiction,
as in life, but he is not to be treated too easily and
casually. It must be shown that he suffers tragically
because he cannot abandon the plow to write poetry,
or the sample-case to study for opera. Lardner is
more realistic. If his typical hero has a secret sorrow
it is that he is too old to take up osteopathy
and too much in dread of his wife to venture into
bootlegging.</p>

<p>Of late a sharply acrid flavor has got into Lardner’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
buffoonery. His baseball players and fifth-rate pugilists,
beginning in his first stories as harmless jackasses,
gradually convert themselves into loathsome
scoundrels. The same change shows itself in Sinclair
Lewis; it is difficult, even for an American, to contemplate
the American without yielding to something
hard to distinguish from moral indignation. Turn,
for example, to the sketches in the volume called
“The Love Nest.” The first tells the story of a
cinema queen married to a magnate of the films.
On the surface she seems to be nothing but a noodle,
but underneath there is a sewer; the woman is such
a pig that she makes one shudder. Again, he investigates
another familiar type: the village practical
joker. The fellow in one form or other, has been
laughed at since the days of Aristophanes. But here
is a mercilessly realistic examination of his dunghill
humor, and of its effects upon decent people.
A third figure is a successful theatrical manager: he
turns out to have the professional competence of a
chiropractor and the honor of a Prohibition agent.
A fourth is a writer of popular songs: stealing other
men’s ideas has become so fixed a habit with him
that he comes to believe that he has an actual right to
them. A fourth is a trained nurse—but I spare you
this dreadful nurse. The rest are bores of the homicidal
type. One gets the effect, communing with the
whole gang, of visiting a museum of anatomy. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
are as shocking as what one encounters there—but
in every detail they are as unmistakably real.</p>

<p>Lardner conceals his new savagery, of course, beneath
his old humor. It does not flag. No man
writing among us has greater skill at the more extravagant
varieties of jocosity. He sees startling
and revelatory likeness between immensely disparate
things, and he is full of pawky observations and bizarre
comments. Two baseball players are palavering,
and one of them, Young Jake, is boasting of
his conquests during Spring practice below the Potomac.
“Down South ain’t here!” replies the
other. “Those dames in some of those swamps, they
lose their head when they see a man with shoes on!”
The two proceed to the discussion of a third imbecile,
guilty of some obscure tort. “Why,” inquires Young
Jake, “didn’t you break his nose or bust him in the
chin?” “His nose was already broke,” replied the
other, “and he didn’t have no chin.” Such wise
cracks seem easy to devise. Broadway diverts itself
by manufacturing them. They constitute the substance
of half the town shows. But in those made by
Lardner there is something far more than mere facile
humor: they are all rigidly in character, and they
illuminate that character. Few American novelists,
great or small, have character more firmly in hand.
Lardner does not see situations; he sees people. And
what people! They are all as revolting as so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Methodist evangelists, and they are all as thoroughly
American.</p>

<h3>4<br>

<i>Masters</i></h3>

<p>The case of Masters remains mysterious; more,
even, than Sherwood Anderson, his fellow fugitive
from a Chicago in decay, he presents an enigma to
the prayerful critic. On the one hand there stands
“The Spoon River Anthology,” unquestionably the
most eloquent, the most profound and the most
thoroughly national volume of poetry published in
America since “Leaves of Grass”; on the other hand
stands a great mass of feeble doggerel—imitations
of Byron, of Browning, of Lowell, of George H.
Boker, of all the bad poets since the dawn of the
Nineteenth Century. Of late he turns to prose, and
with results almost as confusing. In all of his books
there are fine touches, and in one of them, “Mitch
Miller,” there are many of them. But in all of them
there are also banalities so crass and so vast that it
is almost impossible to imagine a literate man letting
them go by. Consider, for example, the novel,
“Mirage.” It seems to me to be one of the most
idiotic and yet one of the most interesting American
novels that I have ever read. Whole pages of it are
given over to philosophical discussions that recall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
nothing so much as the palavers of neighboring barbers
between shaves, and yet they are intermingled
with observations that are shrewd and sound, and that
are set forth with excellent grace and no little eloquence.
Some of the characters in the book are
mere stuffed dummies, creaking in every joint; others
stand out as brilliantly alive as the people of Dreiser
or Miss Cather. My suspicion is that there are actually
two Masterses, that the man is a sort of literary
diplococcus. At his worst, he is intolerably affected,
arty and artificial—almost a fit companion for the
occult, unintelligible geniuses hymned in the <i>Dial</i>.
At his best he probably gets nearer to the essential
truth about the civilization we suffer under than any
other contemporary literatus.</p>

<p>“Mirage,” I daresay, is already forgotten, though
it was published only in 1924. In substance, it is the
story of Skeeters Kirby’s quest for the Wonder
Woman that all sentimentalists seek, and that none of
them finds until drink has brought him to his deathbed,
and he sees the fat, affable nurse through a purple
haze. Skeeters comes from the town of Mitch
Miller, and when we first encounter him he is a
lawyer in Chicago. Already the search for the
Perfect Doll has begun to leave scars upon his psyche.
First there was the sweet one who died before he
could get her to the altar; then there was the naughty
Alicia, his lawful wife, but, as he would say himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
a lemon. As the story opens, Alicia, divorcing him,
had just blackmailed him out of $70,000, almost his
whole fortune, as the price of her silence about Mrs.
Becky Morris. Becky is the widow of a rich old
man, and now enjoys the usufruct of his tenements
and hereditaments. She has red hair and a charming
manner, and is a great liar. She falsely pretends
to have read Schopenhauer’s “The World as
Will and Idea,” and passes in her circle as an intellectual
on the strength of it. She tells Skeeters
that she is virtuous, or, rather, that she <i>has</i> been virtuous,
and all the while she is carrying on with one
Delaher, a handsome frequenter of the Hotel Ritzdorf
in New York. A saucy and poisonous baggage,
this Becky, but Skeeters falls violently in love with
her, and gladly pays Alicia the $70,000 in order to
protect her from scandal. But then she leaves him,
writes him a letter of farewell, and refuses flatly
to marry him, and when he pursues her to New York,
confronts her with her adulteries, and throws up to
her the fact that he has gone broke for her, she
requites him only with a dreadful slanging. I quote
the exact text:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Kirby took a drink of brandy from the flask and came
to her, taking her in his arms. “Tell, me, dear, what shall
we do? Are we engaged?”</p>

<p>Becky shook her head.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“What do you wish? Shall I treat you as my bride-to-be,
or shall we go on as we are now?”</p>

<p>“Go on as we are now!”</p>

<p>“You know I am free now—and it cost me, too, to be
free.”</p>

<p>“How much?”</p>

<p>“Seventy thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“That’s not much.”</p>

<p>“It’s practically all I have.”</p>

<p>“Well, <i>Alicia won’t have such a large income out of it</i>.”</p>

<p>“And I paid it for you.”</p>

<p>Becky opened her eyes. Her face became a bonfire of
rage. Her red hair bristled like a wild animal’s.</p>

<p>“You’re just a liar to say that! And you can’t say such
things in my room. This is my room; <i>I pay for it</i>. And
<i>you can be respectful to me here, or you can go</i>.”</p>

<p>Kirby did not betray his anger. He concentrated it and
went on: “<i>I beg your pardon.</i>”</p>

<p>In a voice as soft as oil he asked:</p>

<p>“Did you see Delaher?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did, and he’s a rough-neck.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“None of your business!”</p>

<p>“None of my business, eh?” Kirby said, with a bitter
intonation.</p>

<p>“Leave my room,” Becky said.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll not leave your room.”</p>

<p>“<i>I’ll have you put out.</i>”</p>

<p>“You don’t dare, Becky—you don’t dare!”...</p>
</div>

<p>Two pages more of this, and then Becky breaks out
grandly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“What do you want, anyway? You have had everything
I have to give: my hospitality, <i>my bread, my wine, my
couch, my affection, gift-tokens of my love</i>—what do you
want?”</p>
</div>

<p>Kirby explains that he wants a wife and a soulmate—“a
mind to be the companion of my mind.”
But Becky refuses to marry him. Instead she goes
to her bedroom and then returns with Kirby’s letters:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Here are your letters. You’ve stayed and had your
say out. And now that you’ve said it, you can see for yourself
that <i>you have no case against me</i>.... Here are your
letters.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want them.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I’ll tear them up.”</p>

<p>She proceeded to do so.</p>

<p>“<i>Now all the evidence is destroyed</i>,” he said.</p>
</div>

<p>I have thrown in a few italics to point the high
spots of this singular colloquy. It goes on for page
after page, and the whole book is filled with dialogues
like it. What is one to make of such inconceivable
banality? Is there worse in “An American Tragedy”?
But Masters, you may say, is trying to depict
eighth-rate people—frequenters of cabarets and hotel
grill-rooms, male and female Elks, dubious hangers-on
upon the edges of intelligence and decency—and
that is how they actually talk. It may be so, but I
note at once two objections to that defense. The first
is that Masters does not appear to regard Kirby as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
eighth-rate; on the contrary, he takes the fellow’s
moony drabbing quite seriously, and even tries to get
a touch of the tragic into it. The second is that precisely
the same hollow and meaningless fustian often
appears when the author speaks in his own person.
The way he tells his story is almost precisely the
way it would be told by a somewhat intellectual
shoe-drummer in a Pullman smoking-room. Its approach
to the eternal sex question, its central theme,
is exactly that of such a gentleman; its very phrases,
in the main, are his phrases. He actually appears,
in fact, as a sort of chorus to the drama, under the
name of Bob Haydon. Bob, facing disillusion and
death, favors Kirby with many cantos of philosophy.
Their general burden is that the prudent man, having
marked a sweet one to his taste, uses her person to
his wicked ends, and then kicks her out. Kirby’s
agonies do not move Bob, and neither do they bore
him. “Bore me!” he exclaims. “This is better than
a circus!”</p>

<p>As I say, I have also enjoyed it myself. It is not,
indeed, without its flashes of genuine sagacity; even
Bob’s stockbroker view of the sexual duel, given such
a male as Kirby and such females as Becky, is probably
more sound than not. But the chief fascination
of the story, I am bound to say, lies in its very deficiencies
as a human document and a work of art—in
its naïve lack of humor, its elaborate laboring of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
the obvious, its incredible stiltedness and triteness.
There are passages that actually suggest Daisy Ashforth.
For example: “She was biting her nails
while talking to Delaher, and biting them after he
left. <i>Then she put on white cotton gloves to prevent
this nervous habit.</i>” Again (Kirby has abandoned
Becky for another girl, Charlotte, formerly his stenographer):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>May I say something to you?</i>” she whispered at last.</p>

<p>“What is it, Charlotte?”</p>

<p>“I want a child, and a child with you.”</p>
</div>

<p>Somehow, this “May I say something to you?”
gives me vast delight: the respectful politeness of the
perfect stenographer surviving into the most confidential
of moments! No such child is achieved—Charlotte,
in fact, dies before it can be born—, and
so we miss her courteous request for permission to
name it after its father. But she and Kirby, alas,
sin the sin, and what is worse, they sin it under his
mother’s roof. What is still worse, they do it with
her knowledge and connivance. She is greatly taken,
in fact, with Charlotte, and advises Kirby to marry
her. I quote her argument:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If Byron had mistresses he was also a rider and a fencer
and a poet; and if Webster may have been a drinker, he
was great as a lawyer and a speaker. If Charlotte has had
extra-marital relationships, she is a capable housekeeper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
a good secretary, a woman skilled in many things; and she
has all kinds of virtues, like humor and self-control, and
the spirit of happiness, and an essential honesty.”</p>
</div>

<p>I leave the rest to posterity! What will it make
of Masters as novelist? When it turns from the
heroic and lovely lines of “Ann Rutledge” to the
astounding banalities of “Mirage” what will it say?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III. IN MEMORIAM: W. J. B.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HAS it been duly marked by historians that
the late William Jennings Bryan’s last
secular act on this globe of sin was to
catch flies? A curious detail, and not without its
sardonic overtones. He was the most sedulous fly-catcher
in American history, and in many ways the
most successful. His quarry, of course, was not
<i>Musca domestica</i> but <i>Homo neandertalensis</i>. For
forty years he tracked it with coo and bellow, up
and down the rustic backways of the Republic.
Wherever the flambeaux of Chautauqua smoked and
guttered, and the bilge of Idealism ran in the veins,
and Baptist pastors dammed the brooks with the
sanctified, and men gathered who were weary and
heavy laden, and their wives who were full of Peruna
and as fecund as the shad (<i>Alosa sapidissima</i>)—there
the indefatigable Jennings set up his traps and
spread his bait. He knew every country town in
the South and West, and he could crowd the most
remote of them to suffocation by simply winding his
horn. The city proletariat, transiently flustered by
him in 1896, quickly penetrated his buncombe and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
would have no more of him; the cockney gallery
jeered him at every Democratic national convention
for twenty-five years. But out where the grass grows
high, and the horned cattle dream away the lazy
afternoons, and men still fear the powers and principalities
of the air—out there between the corn-rows
he held his old puissance to the end. There was no
need of beaters to drive in his game. The news
that he was coming was enough. For miles the
flivver dust would choke the roads. And when he
rose at the end of the day to discharge his Message
there would be such breathless attention, such a rapt
and enchanted ecstasy, such a sweet rustle of amens
as the world had not known since Johann fell to
Herod’s ax.</p>

<p>There was something peculiarly fitting in the fact
that his last days were spent in a one-horse Tennessee
village, and that death found him there. The man
felt at home in such simple and Christian scenes.
He liked people who sweated freely, and were not
debauched by the refinements of the toilet. Making
his progress up and down the Main street of little
Dayton, surrounded by gaping primates from the
upland valleys of the Cumberland Range, his coat
laid aside, his bare arms and hairy chest shining
damply, his bald head sprinkled with dust—so accoutred
and on display he was obviously happy. He
liked getting up early in the morning, to the tune of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
cocks crowing on the dunghill. He liked the heavy,
greasy victuals of the farmhouse kitchen. He liked
country lawyers, country pastors, all country people.
He liked the country sounds and country smells. I
believe that this liking was sincere—perhaps the only
sincere thing in the man. His nose showed no uneasiness
when a hillman in faded overalls and hickory
shirt accosted him on the street, and besought him for
light upon some mystery of Holy Writ. The simian
gabble of the cross-roads was not gabble to him,
but wisdom of an occult and superior sort. In the
presence of city folks he was palpably uneasy.
Their clothes, I suspect, annoyed him, and he was
suspicious of their too delicate manners. He knew
all the while that they were laughing at him—if not
at his baroque theology, then at least at his alpaca
pantaloons. But the yokels never laughed at him.
To them he was not the huntsman but the prophet,
and toward the end, as he gradually forsook mundane
politics for more ghostly concerns, they began to
elevate him in their hierarchy. When he died he
was the peer of Abraham. His old enemy, Wilson,
aspiring to the same white and shining robe, came
down with a thump. But Bryan made the grade.
His place in Tennessee hagiography is secure. If
the village barber saved any of his hair, then it is
curing gallstones down there to-day.</p>

<p>But what label will he bear in more urbane regions?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
One, I fear, of a far less flattering kind.
Bryan lived too long, and descended too deeply into
the mud, to be taken seriously hereafter by fully
literate men, even of the kind who write school-books.
There was a scattering of sweet words in his funeral
notices, but it was no more than a response to conventional
sentimentality. The best verdict the most
romantic editorial writer could dredge up, save in
the humorless South, was to the general effect that
his imbecilities were excused by his earnestness—that
under his clowning, as under that of the juggler
of Notre Dame, there was the zeal of a steadfast
soul. But this was apology, not praise; precisely the
same thing might be said of Mary Baker G. Eddy,
the late Czar Nicholas, or Czolgosz. The truth is
that even Bryan’s sincerity will probably yield to
what is called, in other fields, definitive criticism.
Was he sincere when he opposed imperialism in the
Philippines, or when he fed it with deserving Democrats
in Santo Domingo? Was he sincere when he
tried to shove the Prohibitionists under the table,
or when he seized their banner and began to lead
them with loud whoops? Was he sincere when he
bellowed against war, or when he dreamed of himself
as a tin-soldier in uniform, with a grave reserved
among the generals? Was he sincere when
he denounced the late John W. Davis, or when he
swallowed Davis? Was he sincere when he fawned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
over Champ Clark, or when he betrayed Clark? Was
he sincere when he pleaded for tolerance in New
York, or when he bawled for the faggot and the
stake in Tennessee?</p>

<p>This talk of sincerity, I confess, fatigues me. If
the fellow was sincere, then so was P. T. Barnum.
The word is disgraced and degraded by such uses.
He was, in fact, a charlatan, a mountebank, a zany
without shame or dignity. His career brought him
into contact with the first men of his time; he preferred
the company of rustic ignoramuses. It was
hard to believe, watching him at Dayton, that he had
traveled, that he had been received in civilized societies,
that he had been a high officer of state. He
seemed only a poor clod like those around him, deluded
by a childish theology, full of an almost
pathological hatred of all learning, all human dignity,
all beauty, all fine and noble things. He was a
peasant come home to the barnyard. Imagine a
gentleman, and you have imagined everything that
he was not. What animated him from end to end
of his grotesque career was simply ambition—the
ambition of a common man to get his hand upon the
collar of his superiors, or, failing that, to get his
thumb into their eyes. He was born with a roaring
voice, and it had the trick of inflaming half-wits.
His whole career was devoted to raising those half-wits
against their betters, that he himself might shine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
His last battle will be grossly misunderstood if it
is thought of as a mere exercise in fanaticism—that
is, if Bryan the Fundamentalist Pope is mistaken
for one of the bucolic Fundamentalists. There was
much more in it than that, as everyone knows who
saw him on the field. What moved him, at bottom,
was simply hatred of the city men who had laughed at
him so long, and brought him at last to so tatterdemalion
an estate. He lusted for revenge upon
them. He yearned to lead the anthropoid rabble
against them, to punish them for their execution
upon him by attacking the very vitals of their civilization.
He went far beyond the bounds of any merely
religious frenzy, however inordinate. When he
began denouncing the notion that man is a mammal
even some of the hinds at Dayton were agape. And
when, brought upon Darrow’s cruel hook, he writhed
and tossed in a very fury of malignancy, bawling
against the baldest elements of sense and decency
like a man frantic—when he came to that tragic
climax of his striving there were snickers among the
hinds as well as hosannas.</p>

<p>Upon that hook, in truth, Bryan committed suicide,
as a legend as well as in the body. He staggered
from the rustic court ready to die, and he staggered
from it ready to be forgotten, save as a character in a
third-rate farce, witless and in poor taste. It was
plain to everyone who knew him, when he came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
Dayton, that his great days were behind him—that,
for all the fury of his hatred, he was now definitely
an old man, and headed at last for silence. There
was a vague, unpleasant manginess about his appearance;
he somehow seemed dirty, though a close glance
showed him as carefully shaven as an actor, and
clad in immaculate linen. All the hair was gone
from the dome of his head, and it had begun to
fall out, too, behind his ears, in the obscene manner
of the late Samuel Gompers. The resonance had
departed from his voice; what was once a bugle
blast had become reedy and quavering. Who knows
that, like Demosthenes, he had a lisp? In the old
days, under the magic of his eloquence, no one
noticed it. But when he spoke at Dayton it was
always audible.</p>

<p>When I first encountered him, on the sidewalk in
front of the office of the rustic lawyers who were his
associates in the Scopes case, the trial was yet to
begin, and so he was still expansive and amiable.
I had printed in the <i>Nation</i>, a week or so before,
an article arguing that the Tennessee anti-evolution
law, whatever its wisdom, was at least constitutional—that
the rustics of the State had a clear right to
have their progeny taught whatever they chose, and
kept secure from whatever knowledge violated their
superstitions. The old boy professed to be delighted
with the argument, and gave the gaping bystanders to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
understand that I was a publicist of parts. Not to
be outdone, I admired the preposterous country shirt
that he wore—sleeveless and with the neck cut very
low. We parted in the manner of two ambassadors.
But that was the last touch of amiability that I was
destined to see in Bryan. The next day the battle
joined and his face became hard. By the end of
the week he was simply a walking fever. Hour by
hour he grew more bitter. What the Christian
Scientists call malicious animal magnetism seemed
to radiate from him like heat from a stove. From
my place in the courtroom, standing upon a table,
I looked directly down upon him, sweating horribly
and pumping his palm-leaf fan. His eyes fascinated
me; I watched them all day long. They were blazing
points of hatred. They glittered like occult and
sinister gems. Now and then they wandered to me,
and I got my share, for my reports of the trial had
come back to Dayton, and he had read them. It was
like coming under fire.</p>

<p>Thus he fought his last fight, thirsting savagely
for blood. All sense departed from him. He bit
right and left, like a dog with rabies. He descended
to demagogy so dreadful that his very associates at
the trial table blushed. His one yearning was to
keep his yokels heated up—to lead his forlorn mob
of imbeciles against the foe. That foe, alas, refused
to be alarmed. It insisted upon seeing the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
battle as a comedy. Even Darrow, who knew better,
occasionally yielded to the prevailing spirit. One
day he lured poor Bryan into the folly I have mentioned:
his astounding argument against the notion
that man is a mammal. I am glad I heard it, for
otherwise I’d never believe in it. There stood the man
who had been thrice a candidate for the Presidency
of the Republic—there he stood in the glare of the
world, uttering stuff that a boy of eight would laugh
at! The artful Darrow led him on: he repeated it,
ranted for it, bellowed it in his cracked voice. So
he was prepared for the final slaughter. He came
into life a hero, a Galahad, in bright and shining
armor. He was passing out a poor mountebank.</p>

<p>The chances are that history will put the peak
of democracy in America in his time; it has been on
the downward curve among us since the campaign of
1896. He will be remembered perhaps, as its supreme
impostor, the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of its
pretension. Bryan came very near being President.
In 1896, it is possible, he was actually elected. He
lived long enough to make patriots thank the inscrutable
gods for Harding, even for Coolidge.
Dullness has got into the White House, and the smell
of cabbage boiling, but there is at least nothing to
compare to the intolerable buffoonery that went on
in Tennessee. The President of the United States
may be an ass, but he at least doesn’t believe that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
the earth is square, and that witches should be put to
death, and that Jonah swallowed the whale. The
Golden Text is not painted weekly on the White
House wall, and there is no need to keep ambassadors
waiting while Pastor Simpson, of Smithville, prays
for rain in the Blue Room. We have escaped something—by
a narrow margin, but still we have escaped.</p>

<p>That is, so far. The Fundamentalists, once apparently
sweeping all before them, now face minorities
prepared for battle even in the South—here and
there with some assurance of success. But it is
too early, it seems to me, to send the firemen home;
the fire is still burning on many a far-flung hill,
and it may begin to roar again at any moment. The
evil that men do lives after them. Bryan, in his
malice, started something that it will not be easy
to stop. In ten thousand country towns his old
heelers, the evangelical pastors, are propagating his
gospel, and everywhere the yokels are ready for it.
When he disappeared from the big cities, the big
cities made the capital error of assuming that he was
done for. If they heard of him at all, it was only
as a crimp for real-estate speculators—the heroic foe
of the unearned increment hauling it in with both
hands. He seemed preposterous, and hence harmless.
But all the while he was busy among his old
lieges, preparing for a <i>jacquerie</i> that should floor
all his enemies at one blow. He did his job competently.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
He had vast skill at such enterprises.
Heave an egg out of a Pullman window, and you
will hit a Fundamentalist almost everywhere in the
United States to-day. They swarm in the country
towns, inflamed by their <i>shamans</i>, and with a saint,
now, to venerate. They are thick in the mean streets
behind the gas-works. They are everywhere where
learning is too heavy a burden for mortal minds to
carry, even the vague, pathetic learning on tap in
little red schoolhouses. They march with the Klan,
with the Christian Endeavor Society, with the Junior
Order of United American Mechanics, with the
Epworth League, with all the rococo bands that poor
and unhappy folk organize to bring some light of
purpose into their lives. They have had a thrill,
and they are ready for more.</p>

<p>Such is Bryan’s legacy to his country. He
couldn’t be President, but he could at least help magnificently
in the solemn business of shutting off the
Presidency from every intelligent and self-respecting
man. The storm, perhaps, won’t last long, as time
goes in history. It may help, indeed, to break up
the democratic delusion, now already showing weakness,
and so hasten its own end. But while it lasts
it will blow off some roofs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV. THE HILLS OF ZION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was hot weather when they tried the infidel
Scopes at Dayton, but I went down there very
willingly, for I had good reports of the sub-Potomac
bootleggers, and moreover I was eager to
see something of evangelical Christianity as a going
concern. In the big cities of the Republic, despite
the endless efforts of consecrated men, it is laid up
with a wasting disease. The very Sunday-school
superintendents, taking jazz from the stealthy radio,
shake their fire-proof legs; their pupils, moving into
adolescence, no longer respond to the proliferating
hormones by enlisting for missionary service in
Africa, but resort to necking and petting instead.
I know of no evangelical church from Oregon to
Maine that is not short of money: the graft begins
to peter out, like wire-tapping and three-card monte
before it. Even in Dayton, though the mob was up
to do execution upon Scopes, there was a strong
smell of antinomianism. The nine churches of the
village were all half empty on Sunday, and weeds
choked their yards. Only two or three of the resident
pastors managed to sustain themselves by their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
ghostly science; the rest had to take orders for mail-order
pantaloons or work in the adjacent strawberry
fields; one, I heard, was a barber. On the courthouse
green a score of sweating theologians debated
the darker passages of Holy Writ day and night, but
I soon found that they were all volunteers, and that
the local faithful, while interested in their exegesis as
an intellectual exercise, did not permit it to impede
the indigenous debaucheries. Exactly twelve minutes
after I reached the village I was taken in tow
by a Christian man and introduced to the favorite
tipple of the Cumberland Range: half corn liquor
and half coca-cola. It seemed a dreadful dose to
me, spoiled as I was by the bootleg light wines
and beers of the Eastern seaboard, but I found that
the Dayton illuminati got it down with gusto, rubbing
their tummies and rolling their eyes. I include
among them the chief local proponents of the Mosaic
cosmogony. They were all hot for Genesis, but
their faces were far too florid to belong to teetotalers,
and when a pretty girl came tripping down the Main
street, which was very often, they reached for the
places where their neckties should have been with
all the amorous enterprise of movie actors. It
seemed somehow strange.</p>

<p>An amiable newspaper woman of Chattanooga,
familiar with those uplands, presently enlightened
me. Dayton, she explained, was simply a great capital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
like any other great capital. That is to say, it
was to Rhea county what Atlanta was to Georgia or
Paris to France. That is to say, it was predominantly
epicurean and sinful. A country girl from
some remote valley of the county, coming into town
for her semi-annual bottle of Lydia Pinkham’s Vegetable
Compound, shivered on approaching Robinson’s
drug-store quite as a country girl from up-State
New York might shiver on approaching the Metropolitan
Opera House or the Ritz Hotel. In every
village lout she saw a potential white-slaver. The
hard sidewalks hurt her feet. Temptations of the
flesh bristled to all sides of her, luring her to hell.
This newspaper woman told me of a session with just
such a visitor, holden a few days before. The latter
waited outside one of the town hot-dog and coca-cola
shops while her husband negotiated with a hardware
merchant across the street. The newspaper woman,
idling along and observing that the stranger was
badly used by the heat, invited her to step into the
shop for a glass of coca-cola. The invitation brought
forth only a gurgle of terror. Coca-cola, it quickly
appeared, was prohibited by the country lady’s pastor,
as a levantine and hell-sent narcotic. He also
prohibited coffee and tea—and pies! He had his
doubts about white bread and boughten meat. The
newspaper woman, interested, inquired about ice-cream.
It was, she found, not specifically prohibited,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
but going into a coca-cola shop to get it would
be clearly sinful. So she offered to get a saucer of
it, and bring it out to the sidewalk. The visitor
vacillated—and came near being lost. But God
saved her in the nick of time. When the newspaper
woman emerged from the place she was in full flight
up the street! Later on her husband, mounted on a
mule, overtook her four miles out the mountain pike.</p>

<p>This newspaper woman, whose kindness covered
city infidels as well as Alpine Christians, offered
to take me back in the hills to a place where the
old-time religion was genuinely on tap. The Scopes
jury, she explained was composed mainly of its customers,
with a few Dayton sophisticates added to
leaven the mass. It would thus be instructive to
climb the heights and observe the former at their
ceremonies. The trip, fortunately, might be made
by automobile. There was a road running out of
Dayton to Morgantown, in the mountains to the westward,
and thence beyond. But foreigners, it appeared,
would have to approach the sacred grove cautiously,
for the upland worshipers were very shy,
and at the first sight of a strange face they would adjourn
their orgy and slink into the forest. They
were not to be feared, for God had long since forbidden
them to practice assassination, or even assault,
but if they were alarmed a rough trip would go for
naught. So, after dreadful bumpings up a long and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
narrow road, we parked our car in a little woodpath
a mile or two beyond the tiny village of Morgantown,
and made the rest of the approach on foot, deployed
like skirmishers. Far off in a dark, romantic glade a
flickering light was visible, and out of the silence
came the rumble of exhortation. We could distinguish
the figure of the preacher only as a moving
mote in the light: it was like looking down the tube
of a dark-field microscope. Slowly and cautiously
we crossed what seemed to be a pasture, and then we
crouched down along the edge of a cornfield, and
stealthily edged further and further. The light now
grew larger and we could begin to make out what was
going on. We went ahead on all fours, like snakes
in the grass.</p>

<p>From the great limb of a mighty oak hung a
couple of crude torches of the sort that car inspectors
thrust under Pullman cars when a train pulls in at
night. In the guttering glare was the preacher, and
for a while we could see no one else. He was an
immensely tall and thin mountaineer in blue jeans,
his collarless shirt open at the neck and his hair a
tousled mop. As he preached he paced up and down
under the smoking flambeaux, and at each turn he
thrust his arms into the air and yelled “Glory to
God!” We crept nearer in the shadow of the cornfield,
and began to hear more of his discourse. He
was preaching on the Day of Judgment. The high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
kings of the earth, he roared, would all fall down
and die; only the sanctified would stand up to receive
the Lord God of Hosts. One of these kings
he mentioned by name, the king of what he called
Greece-y. The king of Greece-y, he said, was
doomed to hell. We crawled forward a few more
yards and began to see the audience. It was seated
on benches ranged round the preacher in a circle.
Behind him sat a row of elders, men and women. In
front were the younger folk. We crept on cautiously,
and individuals rose out of the ghostly gloom. A
young mother sat suckling her baby, rocking as the
preacher paced up and down. Two scared little
girls hugged each other, their pigtails down their
backs. An immensely huge mountain woman, in a
gingham dress, cut in one piece, rolled on her heels
at every “Glory to God!” To one side, and but half
visible, was what appeared to be a bed. We found
afterward that half a dozen babies were asleep
upon it.</p>

<p>The preacher stopped at last, and there arose out
of the darkness a woman with her hair pulled back
into a little tight knot. She began so quietly that we
couldn’t hear what she said, but soon her voice rose
resonantly and we could follow her. She was denouncing
the reading of books. Some wandering
book agent, it appeared, had come to her cabin and
tried to sell her a specimen of his wares. She refused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
to touch it. Why, indeed, read a book? If
what was in it was true, then everything in it was
already in the Bible. If it was false, then reading
it would imperil the soul. This syllogism from
Caliph Omar complete, she sat down. There followed
a hymn, led by a somewhat fat brother wearing
silver-rimmed country spectacles. It droned on for
half a dozen stanzas, and then the first speaker resumed
the floor. He argued that the gift of tongues
was real and that education was a snare. Once his
children could read the Bible, he said, they had
enough. Beyond lay only infidelity and damnation.
Sin stalked the cities. Dayton itself was a Sodom.
Even Morgantown had begun to forget God. He sat
down, and a female aurochs in gingham got up. She
began quietly, but was soon leaping and roaring, and
it was hard to follow her. Under cover of the turmoil
we sneaked a bit closer.</p>

<p>A couple of other discourses followed, and there
were two or three hymns. Suddenly a change of
mood began to make itself felt. The last hymn ran
longer than the others, and dropped gradually into a
monotonous, unintelligible chant. The leader beat
time with his book. The faithful broke out with exultations.
When the singing ended there was a brief
palaver that we could not hear, and two of the men
moved a bench into the circle of light directly under
the flambeaux. Then a half-grown girl emerged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
from the darkness and threw herself upon it. We
noticed with astonishment that she had bobbed hair.
“This sister,” said the leader, “has asked for
prayers.” We moved a bit closer. We could now
see faces plainly, and hear every word. What followed
quickly reached such heights of barbaric grotesquerie
that it was hard to believe it real. At a
signal all the faithful crowded up to the bench and
began to pray—not in unison, but each for himself!
At another they all fell on their knees, their arms
over the penitent. The leader kneeled facing us,
his head alternately thrown back dramatically or
buried in his hands. Words spouted from his lips
like bullets from a machine-gun—appeals to God to
pull the penitent back out of hell, defiances of the
demons of the air, a vast impassioned jargon of
apocalyptic texts. Suddenly he rose to his feet,
threw back his head and began to speak in the tongues—blub-blub-blub,
gurgle-gurgle-gurgle. His voice
rose to a higher register. The climax was a shrill,
inarticulate squawk, like that of a man throttled. He
fell headlong across the pyramid of supplicants.</p>

<p>A comic scene? Somehow, no. The poor half-wits
were too horribly in earnest. It was like peeping
through a knothole at the writhings of people in
pain. From the squirming and jabbering mass a
young woman gradually detached herself—a woman
not uncomely, with a pathetic homemade cap on her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
head. Her head jerked back, the veins of her neck
swelled, and her fists went to her throat as if she were
fighting for breath. She bent backward until she
was like half a hoop. Then she suddenly snapped
forward. We caught a flash of the whites of her
eyes. Presently her whole body began to be convulsed—great
throes that began at the shoulders and
ended at the hips. She would leap to her feet, thrust
her arms in air, and then hurl herself upon the heap.
Her praying flattened out into a mere delirious caterwauling,
like that of a Tom cat on a petting party.
I describe the thing discreetly, and as a strict behaviorist.
The lady’s subjective sensations I leave
to infidel pathologists, privy to the works of Ellis,
Freud and Moll. Whatever they were, they were
obviously not painful, for they were accompanied by
vast heavings and gurglings of a joyful and even ecstatic
nature. And they seemed to be contagious,
too, for soon a second penitent, also female, joined
the first, and then came a third, and a fourth, and a
fifth. The last one had an extraordinary violent attack.
She began with mild enough jerks of the head,
but in a moment she was bounding all over the place,
like a chicken with its head cut off. Every time her
head came up a stream of hosannas would issue out
of it. Once she collided with a dark, undersized
brother, hitherto silent and stolid. Contact with her
set him off as if he had been kicked by a mule. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
leaped into the air, threw back his head, and began
to gargle as if with a mouthful of BB shot. Then he
loosed one tremendous, stentorian sentence in the
tongues, and collapsed.</p>

<p>By this time the performers were quite oblivious
to the profane universe and so it was safe to go still
closer. We left our hiding and came up to the
little circle of light. We slipped into the vacant
seats on one of the rickety benches. The heap of
mourners was directly before us. They bounced into
us as they cavorted. The smell that they radiated,
sweating there in that obscene heap, half suffocated
us. Not all of them, of course, did the thing in the
grand manner. Some merely moaned and rolled
their eyes. The female ox in gingham flung her great
bulk on the ground and jabbered an unintelligible
prayer. One of the men, in the intervals between fits,
put on his spectacles and read his Bible. Beside me
on the bench sat the young mother and her baby.
She suckled it through the whole orgy, obviously
fascinated by what was going on, but never venturing
to take any hand in it. On the bed just outside the
light half a dozen other babies slept peacefully. In
the shadows, suddenly appearing and as suddenly
going away, were vague figures, whether of believers
or of scoffers I do not know. They seemed to come
and go in couples. Now and then a couple at the
ringside would step out and vanish into the black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
night. After a while some came back, the males
looking somewhat sheepish. There was whispering
outside the circle of vision. A couple of Fords
lurched up the road, cutting holes in the darkness
with their lights. Once someone out of sight loosed
a bray of laughter.</p>

<p>All this went on for an hour or so. The original
penitent, by this time, was buried three deep beneath
the heap. One caught a glimpse, now and then, of
her yellow bobbed hair, but then she would vanish
again. How she breathed down there I don’t know;
it was hard enough six feet away, with a strong five-cent
cigar to help. When the praying brothers would
rise up for a bout with the tongues their faces were
streaming with perspiration. The fat harridan in
gingham sweated like a longshoreman. Her hair
got loose and fell down over her face. She fanned
herself with her skirt. A powerful old gal she was,
plainly equal in her day to a bout with obstetrics and
a week’s washing on the same morning, but this was
worse than a week’s washing. Finally, she fell into
a heap, breathing in great, convulsive gasps.</p>

<p>Finally, we got tired of the show and returned to
Dayton. It was nearly eleven o’clock—an immensely
late hour for those latitudes—but the whole town was
still gathered in the courthouse yard, listening to the
disputes of theologians. The Scopes trial had
brought them in from all directions. There was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
friar wearing a sandwich sign announcing that he
was the Bible champion of the world. There was
a Seventh Day Adventist arguing that Clarence
Darrow was the beast with seven heads and ten horns
described in Revelation xiii, and that the end of
the world was at hand. There was an evangelist
made up like Andy Gump, with the news that atheists
in Cincinnati were preparing to descend upon Dayton,
hang the eminent Judge Raulston, and burn the town.
There was an ancient who maintained that no Catholic
could be a Christian. There was the eloquent Dr.
T. T. Martin, of Blue Mountain, Miss., come to town
with a truck-load of torches and hymn-books to put
Darwin in his place. There was a singing brother
bellowing apocalyptic hymns. There was William
Jennings Bryan, followed everywhere by a gaping
crowd. Dayton was having a roaring time. It was
better than the circus. But the note of devotion was
simply not there; the Daytonians, after listening a
while, would slip away to Robinson’s drug-store to
regale themselves with coca-cola, or to the lobby of
the Aqua Hotel, where the learned Raulston sat in
state, judicially picking his teeth. The real religion
was not present. It began at the bridge over the
town creek, where the road makes off for the hills.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">V. BEETHOVEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BEETHOVEN was one of those lucky men
whose stature, viewed in retrospect, grows
steadily. How many movements have there
been to put him on the shelf? At least a dozen in
the hundred years since his death. There was one
only a few years ago in New York, launched by idiot
critics and supported by the war fever: his place,
it appeared, was to be taken by such prophets of the
new enlightenment as Stravinsky! The net result
of that movement was simply that the best orchestra
in America went to pot—and Beethoven survived unscathed.
It is, indeed, almost impossible to imagine
displacing him—at all events, in the concert-hall,
where the challenge of Bach cannot reach him.
Surely the Nineteenth Century was not deficient in
master musicians. It produced Schubert, Schumann,
Chopin, Wagner and Brahms, to say nothing of a
whole horde of Dvořáks, Tschaikowskys, Debussys,
Raffs, Verdis and Puccinis. Yet it gave us nothing
better than the first movement of the Eroica. That
movement, the first challenge of the new music,
remains its last word. It is the noblest piece of
absolute music ever written in the sonata form, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
it is the noblest piece of program music. In
Beethoven, indeed, the distinction between the two
became purely imaginary. Everything he wrote was,
in a way, program music, including even the first
two symphonies, and everything was absolute music,
including even the Battle grotesquerie. (Is the
latter, indeed, as bad as ancient report makes it?
Why doesn’t some <i>Kappellmeister</i> let us hear it?)</p>

<p>It was a bizarre jest of the gods to pit Beethoven,
in his first days in Vienna, against Papa Haydn.
Haydn was undeniably a genius of the first water,
and, after Mozart’s death, had no apparent reason to
fear a rival. If he did not actually create the symphony
as we know it to-day, then he at least enriched
the form with its first genuine masterpieces—and
not with a scant few, but literally with dozens.
Tunes of the utmost loveliness gushed from him like
oil from a well. More, he knew how to manage
them; he was a master of musical architectonics.
If his music is sniffed at to-day, then it is only by
fools; there are at least six of his symphonies that
are each worth all the cacophony hatched by
a whole herd of Schönbergs and Eric Saties, with a
couple of Korngolds thrown in to flavor the pot.
But when Beethoven stepped in, then poor old Papa
had to step down. It was like pitting a gazelle
against an aurochs. One colossal bellow, and the
combat was over. Musicians are apt to look at it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
as a mere contest of technicians. They point to
the vastly greater skill and ingenuity of Beethoven—his
firmer grip upon his materials, his greater daring
and resourcefulness, his far better understanding
of dynamics, rhythms and clang-tints—in brief, his
tremendously superior musicianship. But that was
not what made him so much greater than Haydn—for
Haydn, too, had his superiorities; for example, his
far readier inventiveness, his capacity for making
better tunes. What lifted Beethoven above the old
master, and above all other men of music save perhaps
Bach and Brahms, was simply his greater dignity
as a man. The feelings that Haydn put into
tone were the feelings of a country pastor, a rather
civilized stockbroker, a viola player gently mellowed
by Kulmbacher. When he wept it was with the
tears of a woman who has discovered another
wrinkle; when he rejoiced it was with the joy of
a child on Christmas morning. But the feelings
that Beethoven put into his music were the feelings
of a god. There was something olympian in his
snarls and rages, and there was a touch of hell-fire
in his mirth.</p>

<p>It is almost a literal fact that there is not a trace
of cheapness in the whole body of his music. He is
never sweet and romantic; he never sheds conventional
tears; he never strikes orthodox attitudes.
In his lightest moods there is the immense and inescapable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
dignity of the ancient Hebrew prophets.
He concerns himself, not with the puerile agonies
of love, but with the eternal tragedy of man. He is
a great tragic poet, and like all great tragic poets,
he is obsessed by a sense of the inscrutable meaninglessness
of life. From the Eroica onward he
seldom departs from that theme. It roars through
the first movement of the C minor, and it comes to
a stupendous final statement in the Ninth. All this,
in his day, was new in music, and so it caused murmurs
of surprise and even indignation. The step
from Mozart’s Jupiter to the first movement of the
Eroica was uncomfortable; the Viennese began to
wriggle in their stalls. But there was one among
them who didn’t wriggle, and that was Franz Schubert.
Turn to the first movement of his Unfinished
or to the slow movement of his Tragic, and you will
see how quickly the example of Beethoven was followed—and
with what genius! But there was a
long hiatus after that, with Mendelssohn, Weber,
Chopin and company performing upon their pretty
pipes. Eventually the day of November 6, 1876,
dawned in Karlsruhe, and with it came the first performance
of Brahms’ C minor. Once more the gods
walked in the concert-hall. They will walk again
when another Brahms is born, but not before. For
nothing can come out of an artist that is not in the
man. What ails the music of all the Tschaikowskys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
Stravinskys—and Strausses? What ails it is that
it is the music of shallow men. It is often, in its
way, lovely. It bristles with charming musical
ideas. It is infinitely ingenious and workmanlike.
But it is as hollow, at bottom, as a bull by Bishop
Manning. It is the music of second-rate men.</p>

<p>Beethoven disdained all their artifices: he didn’t
need them. It would be hard to think of a composer,
even of the fourth rate, who worked with thematic
material of less intrinsic merit. He borrowed tunes
wherever he found them; he made them up out of
snatches of country jigs; when he lacked one altogether
he contented himself with a simple phrase, a
few banal notes. All such things he viewed simply
as raw materials; his interest was concentrated upon
their use. To that use of them he brought the appalling
powers of his unrivaled genius. His ingenuity
began where that of other men left off. His most
complicated structures retained the overwhelming clarity
of the Parthenon. And into them he got a kind of
feeling that even the Greeks could seldom match; he
was preëminently a modern man, with all trace of
the barbarian vanished. In his gorgeous music there
went all of the high skepticism that was of the essence
of the Eighteenth Century, but into it there also went
the new enthusiasm, the new determination to challenge
and beat the gods, that dawned with the Nineteenth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>The older I grow, the more I am convinced that the
most portentous phenomenon in the whole history
of music was the first public performance of the
Eroica on April 7, 1805. The manufacturers of
program notes have swathed that gigantic work
in so many layers of childish legend and speculation
that its intrinsic merits have been almost forgotten.
Was it dedicated to Napoleon I? If so, was the
dedication sincere or ironical? Who cares—that is,
who with ears? It might have been dedicated, just
as well, to Louis XIV, Paracelsus or Pontius Pilate.
What makes it worth discussing, to-day and forever,
is the fact that on its very first page Beethoven threw
his hat into the ring and laid his claim to immortality.
Bang!—and he is off! No compromise! No easy
bridge from the past! The Second Symphony is
already miles behind. A new order of music has
been born. The very manner of it is full of challenge.
There is no sneaking into the foul business
by way of a mellifluous and disarming introduction;
no preparatory hemming and hawing to cajole the
audience and enable the conductor to find his place
in the score. Nay! Out of silence comes the angry
crash of the tonic triad, and then at once, with no
pause, the first statement of the first subject—grim,
domineering, harsh, raucous, and yet curiously
lovely—with its astounding collision with that electrical
C sharp. The carnage has begun early; we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
are only in the seventh measure! In the thirteenth
and fourteenth comes the incomparable roll down the
simple scale of E flat—and what follows is all that
has ever been said, perhaps all that ever <i>will</i> be said,
about music-making in the grand manner. What was
afterward done, even by Beethoven, was done in the
light of that perfect example. Every line of modern
music that is honestly music bears some sort of relation
to that epoch-making first movement.</p>

<p>The rest is Beethovenish, but not quintessence.
There is a legend that the funeral march was put in
simply because it was a time of wholesale butchery,
and funeral marches were in fashion. No doubt the
first-night audience in Vienna, shocked and addled
by the piled-up defiances of the first movement, found
the lugubrious strains grateful. But the <i>scherzo</i>?
Another felonious assault upon poor Papa Haydn!
Two giants boxing clumsily, to a crazy piping by an
orchestra of dwarfs. No wonder some honest
Viennese in the gallery yelled: “I’d give another
kreutzer if the thing would stop!” Well, it stopped
finally, and then came something reassuring—a
theme with variations. Everyone in Vienna knew
and esteemed Beethoven’s themes with variations.
He was, in fact, the rising master of themes with
variations in the town. But a joker remained in the
pack. The variations grew more and more complex
and surprising. Strange novelties got into them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
The polite exercises became tempestuous, moody,
cacophonous, tragic. At the end a harsh, hammering,
exigent row of chords—the C minor Symphony
casting its sinister shadow before!</p>

<p>It must have been a great night in Vienna. But
perhaps not for the actual Viennese. They went to
hear “a new grand symphony in D sharp” (<i>sic!</i>).
What they found in the Theater-an-der-Wien was a
revolution!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI. RONDO ON AN ANCIENT
THEME</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is the economic emancipation of woman, I
suppose, that must be blamed for the present
wholesale discussion of the sex question, so
offensive to the romantic. Eminent authorities have
full often described, and with the utmost heat and
eloquence, her state before she was delivered from
her fetters and turned loose to root or die. Almost
her only feasible trade, in those dark days, was that
of wife. True enough, she might also become a
servant girl, or go to work in a factory, or offer herself
upon the streets, but all of those vocations were
so revolting that no rational woman followed them if
she could help it: she would leave any one of them at
a moment’s notice at the call of a man, for the call
of a man meant promotion for her, economically and
socially. The males of the time, knowing what a
boon they had to proffer, drove hard bargains. They
demanded a long list of high qualities in the woman
they summoned to their seraglios, but most of all
they demanded what they called virtue. It was not
sufficient that a candidate should be anatomically undefiled;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
she must also be pure in mind. There was,
of course, but one way to keep her so pure, and
that was by building a high wall around her mind,
and hitting her with a club every time she ventured to
peer over it. It was as dangerous, in that Christian
era, for a woman to show any interest in or knowledge
of the great physiological farce of sex as it would be
to-day for a presidential candidate to reveal himself
in his cups on the hustings. Everyone knew, to be
sure, that as a mammal she had sex, and that as a
potential wife and mother she probably had some
secret interest in its phenomena, but it was felt, perhaps
wisely, that even the most academic theorizing
had within it the deadly germs of the experimental
method, and so she was forbidden to think about the
matter at all, and whatever information she acquired
at all she had to acquire by a method of bootlegging.</p>

<p>The generation still on its legs has seen the almost
total collapse of that naïve and constabulary system,
and of the economic structure supporting it. Beginning
with the eighties of the last century, there rose up
a harem rebellion which quickly knocked both to
pieces. Two women of the Western World not only began
to plunge heroically into all of the old professions,
hitherto sacred to men; they also began to invent a
lot of new professions, many of them unimagined by
men. Worse, they began to succeed in them. The
working woman of the old days worked only until she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
could snare a man; any man was better than her work.
But the working woman of the new days was under
no such pressure; her work made her a living and
sometimes more than a living; when a man appeared in
her net she took two looks at him, one of them usually
very searching, before landing him. The result was
an enormous augmentation of her feeling of self-sufficiency,
her spirit of independence, her natural
inclination to get two sides into the bargaining. The
result, secondarily, was a revolt against all the old
taboos that had surrounded her, all the childish incapacities
and ignorances that had been forced upon
her. The result, tertiarily, was a vast running amok
in the field that, above all others, had been forbidden
to her: that of sexual knowledge and experiment.</p>

<p>We now suffer from the effects of that running
amok. It is women, not men, who are doing all the
current gabbling about sex, and proposing all the
new-fangled modifications of the rules and regulations
ordained by God, and they are hard at it very
largely, I suppose, because being at it at all is a privilege
that is still new to them. The whole order of
human females, in other words, is passing through a
sort of intellectual adolescence, and it is disturbed
as greatly as biological adolescents are by the spouting
of the hormones. The attitude of men toward
the sex question, it seems to me, has not changed
greatly in my time. Barring a few earnest men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
whose mental processes, here as elsewhere, are essentially
womanish, they still view it somewhat
jocosely. Taking one with another, they believe that
they know all about it that is worth knowing, and so
it does not challenge their curiosity, and they do not
put in much time discussing it, save mockingly. But
among the women, if a bachelor may presume to
judge, interest in it is intense. They want to know
all that is known about it, all that has been guessed
and theorized about it; they bristle with ideas of their
own about it. It is hard to find a reflective woman,
in these days, who is not harboring some new and
startling scheme for curing the evils of monogamous
marriage; it is impossible to find any woman who has
not given ear to such schemes. Women, not men,
read the endless books upon the subject that now rise
mountain-high in all the book-stores, and women, not
men, discuss and rediscuss the notions in them. An
acquaintance of mine, a distinguished critic, owns a
copy of one of the most revolutionary of these books,
by title “The Art of Love,” that was suppressed on
the day of its publication by the alert Comstocks. He
tells me that he has already lent it to twenty-six women
and that he has more than fifty applications for it
on file. Yet he has never read it himself!</p>

<p>As a professional fanatic for free thought and free
speech, I can only view all this uproar in the <i>Frauenzimmer</i>
with high satisfaction. It gives me delight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
to see a taboo violated, and that delight is doubled
when the taboo is one that is wholly senseless. Sex
is more important to women than to men, and so they
ought to be free to discuss it as they please, and to
hatch and propagate whatever ideas about it occur to
them. Moreover, I can see nothing but nonsense in
the doctrine that their concern with such matters
damages their charm. So far as I am concerned, a
woman who knows precisely what a Graafian follicle
is is just as charming as one who doesn’t—just as
charming, and far less dangerous. Charm in women,
indeed, is a variable star, and shows different colors
at different times. When their chief mark was ignorance,
then the most ignorant was the most charming;
now that they begin to think deeply and indignantly
there is charm in their singular astuteness.
But I am inclined to believe that they have not yet
attained to a genuine astuteness in the new field of
sex. To the contrary, it seems to me that a fundamental
error contaminates their whole dealing with
the subject, and that is the error of assuming that sexual
questions, whether social, physiological, or pathological,
are of vast and even paramount importance
to mankind in general—in brief, that sex is really a
first-rate matter.</p>

<p>I doubt it. I believe that in this department men
show better judgment than women, if only because
their information is older and their experience wider.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
Their tendency is to dismiss the whole thing lightly,
to reduce sex to the lowly estate of an afterthought
and a recreation, and under that tendency there is
a sound instinct. I do not believe that the lives of
normal men are much colored or conditioned, either
directly or indirectly, by purely sexual considerations.
I believe that nine-tenths of them would carry
on all the activities which engage them now, and with
precisely the same humorless diligence, if there were
not a woman in the world. The notion that man
would not work if he lacked an audience, and that the
audience must be a woman, seems to me to be a
hollow sentimentality. Men work because they want
to eat, because they want to feel secure, because they
long to shine among their fellows, and for no other
reason. A man may crave his wife’s approbation, or
some other woman’s approbation, of his social graces,
of his taste, of his generosity and courage, of his
general dignity in the world, but long before he ever
gives thought to such things and long after he has
forgotten them he craves the approbation of his fellow
men. Above all, he craves the approbation of his
fellow craftsmen—the men who understand exactly
what he is trying to do, and are expertly competent
to judge his doing of it. Can you imagine a surgeon
putting the good opinion of his wife above the good
opinion of other surgeons? If you, can, then you can
do something that I cannot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>Here, of course, I do not argue absurdly that the
good opinion of his wife is nothing to him. Obviously,
it is a lot, for if it does not constitute the
principal reward of his work, then it at least constitutes
the principal joy of his hours of ease, when his
work is done. He wants his wife to respect and admire
him; to be able to make her do it is also a
talent. But if he is intelligent he must discover very
early that her respect and admiration do not necessarily
run in direct ratio to his intrinsic worth, that
the qualities and acts that please her are not always
the qualities and acts that are most satisfactory to
the censor within him—in brief, that the relation between
man and woman, however intimate they may
seem, must always remain a bit casual and superficial—that
sex, at bottom, belongs to comedy and the cool
of the evening and not to the sober business that goes
on in the heat of the day. That sober business, as I
have said, would still go on if woman were abolished
and heirs and assigns were manufactured in rolling-mills.
Men would not only work as hard as they do
to-day; they would also get almost as much satisfaction
out of their work. For of all the men that I
know on this earth, ranging from poets to ambassadors
and from bishops to statisticians, I know none
who labors primarily because he wants to please a
woman. They are all hard at it because they want
to impress other men and so please themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>Women, plainly enough, are in a far different case.
Their emancipation has not yet gone to the length of
making them genuinely free. They have rid themselves,
very largely, of the absolute need to please
men, but they have not yet rid themselves of the impulse
to please men. Perhaps they never will: one
might easily devise a plausible argument to that effect
on biological grounds. But sufficient unto the
day is the phenomenon before us: they have got rid
of the old taboo which forbade them to think and
talk about sex, and they still labor under the old
superstition that sex is a matter of paramount importance.
The result, in my judgment, is an absurd
emission of piffle. In every division there is vast
and often ludicrous exaggeration. The campaign
for birth control takes on the colossal proportions of
the war for democracy. The venereal diseases are
represented to be as widespread, at least in men, as
colds in the head, and as lethal as apoplexy or cancer.
Great hordes of viragoes patrol the country, instructing
school-girls in the mechanics of reproduction and
their mothers in obstetrics. The light-hearted monogamy
which produced all of us is denounced as an infamy
comparable to cannibalism. Laws are passed
regulating the mating of human beings as if they were
horned cattle and converting marriage into a sort of
coroner’s inquest. Over all sounds the battle-cry of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
quacks and zealots at all times and everywhere:
<i>Veritas liberabit vos!</i></p>

<p>The truth? How much of this new gospel is
actually truth? Perhaps two per cent. The rest is
idle theorizing, doctrinaire nonsense, mere scandalous
rubbish. All that is worth knowing about sex—all,
that is, that is solidly established and of sound utility—can
be taught to any intelligent boy of sixteen in
two hours. Is it taught in the current books, so
enormously circulated? I doubt it. Absolutely
without exception these books admonish the poor apprentice
to renounce sex altogether—to sublimate it,
as the favorite phrase is, into a passion for free verse,
Rotary or the League of Nations. This admonition
is silly, and, I believe, dangerous. It is as much a
folly to lock up sex in the hold as it is to put it in command
on the bridge. Its proper place is in the social
hall. As a substitute for all such nonsense I drop a
pearl of wisdom, and pass on. To wit: the strict
monogamist never gets into trouble.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII. PROTESTANTISM IN THE
REPUBLIC</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT Protestantism in this great Christian
realm is down with a wasting disease must be
obvious to every amateur of ghostly pathology.
The denominational papers are full of alarming
reports from its bedside, and all sorts of projects
for the relief of the patient. One authority holds that
only more money is needed to work a cure—that if the
Christian exploiters and usurers of the country would
provide a sufficient slush fund, all the vacant pews
could be filled, and the baptismal tanks with them.
Another authority argues that the one way to save
the churches is to close all other places of resort and
amusement on the Sabbath, from delicatessen shops to
road-houses, and from movie parlors to jazz palaces.
Yet another proposes a mass attack by prayer, apparently
in the hope of provoking a miracle. A fourth
advocates a vast augmentation of so-called institutional
effort, <i>i. e.</i>, the scheme of putting bowling
alleys and courting cubicles into church cellars, and
of giving over the rest of every sacred edifice to debates
on the Single Tax, boxing matches, baby shows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
mental hygiene clinics, lectures by converted actors,
movie shows, raffles, non-voluptuous dances, and
evening classes in salesmanship, automobile repairing,
birth control, interior decoration, and the art and
mystery of the realtor. A fifth, borrowing a leaf
from Big Business, maintains that consolidation and
reorganization are what is needed—that the existence
of half a dozen rival churches in every American
village profits the devil a great deal more than it
profits God. This last scheme seems to have won a
great deal of support among the pious. At least a
score of committees are now trying to draw up plans
for concrete consolidations, and even the Southern and
Northern Methodists, who hate each other violently,
have been in peaceful though vain negotiation.</p>

<p>On the merits of these conflicting remedies I attempt
no pronouncement, but I have been at some
pains to look into the symptoms and nature of the
disease. My report is that it seems to me to be
analogous to that malady which afflicts a star in the
heavens when it splits into two halves and they go
slambanging into space in opposite directions. That,
in brief, is what appears to be the matter with Protestantism
in the United States to-day. One half of it
is moving, with slowly accelerating speed, in the direction
of the Harlot of the Seven Hills: the other is
sliding down into voodooism. The former carries
the greater part of Protestant money with it; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
latter carries the greater part of Protestant enthusiasm,
or, as the word now is, pep. What remains
in the middle may be likened to a torso without
either brains to think with or legs to dance—in other
words, something that begins to be professionally attractive
to the mortician, though it still makes shift to
breathe. There is no lack of life on the higher levels,
where the most solvent Methodists and the like are
gradually transmogrified into Episcopalians, and the
Episcopalians shin up the ancient bastions of Holy
Church, and there is no lack of life on the lower
levels, where the rural Baptists, by the route of Fundamentalism,
the Anti-Saloon League, and the Ku
Klux Klan, rapidly descend to the dogmas and practices
of the Congo jungle. But in the middle there
is desiccation and decay. Here is where Protestantism
was once strongest. Here is the region of the
plain and godly Americano, fond of devotion but distrustful
of every hint of orgy—the honest fellow who
suffers dutifully on Sunday, pays his share, and
hopes for a few kind words from the pastor when
his time comes to die. He stands to-day on a burning
deck. It is no wonder that Sunday automobiling
begins to get him in its clutches. If he is not staggered
one day by his pastor’s appearance in surplice
and stole, he is staggered the day following by a file
of Ku Kluxers marching up the aisle. So he tends
to absent himself from pious exercises, and the news<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
goes about that there is something the matter with the
churches, and the denominational papers bristle with
schemes to set it right, and many up-and-coming pastors,
tiring of preaching and parish work, get excellent
jobs as the executive secretaries of these
schemes, and go about the country expounding them
to the faithful.</p>

<p>The extent to which Protestantism, in its upper
reaches, has succumbed to the harlotries of Rome
seems to be but little apprehended by the majority of
connoisseurs. I was myself unaware of the whole
truth until last Christmas, when, in the pursuit of a
quite unrelated inquiry, I employed agents to attend
all the services held in the principal Protestant basilicas
of an eminent American city, and to bring in
the best reports they could formulate upon what went
on in the lesser churches. The substance of these reports,
in so far as they related to churches patronized
by the well-to-do, was simple: they revealed a headlong
movement to the right, an almost precipitate
flight over the mountain. Six so-called Episcopal
churches held midnight services on Christmas Eve in
obvious imitation of Catholic midnight masses, and
one of them actually called its service a solemn high
mass. Two invited the nobility and gentry to processions,
and a third concealed a procession under
the name of a pageant. One offered Gounod’s St.
Cecilia mass on Christmas morning, and another the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
Messe Solennelle by the same composer; three others,
somewhat more timorous, contented themselves with
parts of masses. One, throwing off all pretense and
euphemism, summoned the faithful to no less than
three Christmas masses, naming them by name—two
low and one high. All six churches were aglow with
candles, and two employed incense.</p>

<p>But that was not the worst. Two Presbyterian
churches and one Baptist church, not to mention five
Lutheran churches of different synods, had choral
services in the dawn of Christmas morning, and the
one attended by the only one of my agents who got
up early enough—it was in a Presbyterian church—was
made gay with candles, and had a palpably Roman
smack. Yet worse: a rich and conspicuous
Methodist church, patronized by the leading Wesleyan
wholesalers and money-lenders of the town,
boldly offered a mediæval carol service. Mediæval?
What did that mean? The Middle Ages ended on
July 16, 1453, at 12 o’clock meridian, and the Reformation
was not launched by Luther until October
31, 1517, at 10.15 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> If mediæval, in the sense
in which it was here used, does not mean Roman
Catholic, then I surely went to school in vain. My
agent, born a Methodist, reported that the whole
ceremony shocked him excessively. It began with
trumpet blasts from the church spire and it concluded
with an Ave Maria by a vested choir! Candles rose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
up in glittering ranks behind the chancel rail, and
above them glowed a shining electric star. God help
us all, indeed! What next? Will the rev. pastor,
on some near to-morrow, defy the lightnings of
Jahveh by appearing in alb and dalmatic? Will he
turn his back upon the faithful? Will he put in a
telephone-booth for auricular confession? I shudder
to think of what old John Wesley would have said
about that vested choir and that shining star. Or
Bishop Francis Asbury. Or the Rev. Jabez Bunting.
Or Robert Strawbridge, that consecrated man.</p>

<p>Here, of course, I do not venture into the contumacy
of criticising; I merely marvel. A student
of the sacred sciences all my life, I am well learned
in the dogmas and ceremonials of the sects, and know
what they affect and what they abhor. Does anyone
argue that the use of candles in public worship would
have had the sanction of the <i>Ur</i>-Wesleyans, or that
they would have consented to <i>Blasmusik</i> and a vested
choir? If so, let the sciolist come forward. Down to
fifty years ago, in fact, the Methodists prohibited
Christmas services altogether, as Romish and heathen.
But now we have ceremonies almost operatic,
and the sweet masses of Gounod are just around the
corner! As I have said, the Episcopalians—who, in
most American cities, are largely ex-Methodists or
ex-Presbyterians, or, in New York, ex-Jews—go still
further. In three of the churches attended by my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
agents Holy Communion was almost indistinguishable
from the mass. Two of these churches, according
to information placed at my disposal by the police,
are very fashionable; to get into one of them is almost
as difficult as ordering a suit of clothes from
Poole. But the richer the Episcopalian, the more
eager he is to forget that he was once baptized by
public outcry or total immersion. The Low Church
rectors, in the main, struggle with poor congregations,
born to the faith but deficient in buying power. As
bank accounts increase the fear of the devil diminishes,
and there is bred a sense of beauty. This
sense of beauty, in its practical effects, is identical
with the work of the Paulist Fathers. To-day, indeed,
even the Methodists who remain Methodists
begin to wobble. Tiring of the dreadful din that
goes with the orthodox Wesleyan demonology, they
take to ceremonials that grow more and more stately
and voluptuous. The sermon ceases to be a cavalry
charge, and becomes soft and <i>pizzicato</i>. The choir
abandons “Throw Out the Life-Line” and “Are You
Ready for the Judgment Day?” and toys with
Händel. The rev. pastor throws off the uniform of a
bank cashier and puts on a gown. It is an evolution
that has, viewed from a tree, a certain merit. The
stock of nonsense in the world is sensibly diminished
and the stock of beauty augmented. But what would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
the old-time circuit-riders say of it, imagining them
miraculously brought back from hell?</p>

<p>So much for the volatilization that is going on
above the diaphragm. What is in progress below?
All I can detect is a rapid descent to mere barbaric
devil-chasing. In all those parts of the Republic
where Beelzebub is still as real as Babe Ruth or Dr.
Coolidge, and men drink raw fusel oil hot from the
still—for example, in the rural sections of the Middle
West and everywhere in the South save a few walled
towns—the evangelical sects plunge into an abyss of
malignant imbecility, and declare a holy war upon
every decency that civilized men cherish. First the
Anti-Saloon League, and now the Ku Klux Klan and
the various Fundamentalist organizations, have converted
them into vast machines for pursuing and
butchering unbelievers. They have thrown the New
Testament overboard, and gone back to the Old, and
particularly to the bloodiest parts of it. Their one
aim seems to be to break heads, to spread terror,
to propagate hatred. Everywhere they have set up enmities
that will not die out for generations. Neighbor
looks askance at neighbor, the land is filled with spies,
every man of the slightest intelligence is suspect.
Christianity becomes a sort of psychic cannibalism.
Unfortunately, the doings of the rustic gentlemen
of God who furnish steam for this movement have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
been investigated but imperfectly, and in consequence
too little is known about them. Even the sources of
their power, so far as I know, have not been looked
into. My suspicion is that it has increased as the
influence of the old-time country-town newspapers
has declined. These newspapers, in large areas
of the land, once genuinely molded public opinion.
They attracted to their service a shrewd and salty
class of rustic philosophers, mainly highly alcoholized;
they were outspoken in their views and responded
only slightly to the prevailing crazes. In
the midst of the Bryan uproar, a quarter of a century
ago, scores of little weeklies in the South and Middle
West kept up a gallant battle for sound money and the
Hanna idealism. There were red-hot Democratic papers
in Pennsylvania, and others in Ohio; there were
Republican sheets in rural Maryland, and even in
Virginia. The growth of the big city dailies is what
chiefly reduced them to puerility. As communications
improved every yokel began following Brisbane,
Dr. Frank Crane, and Mutt and Jeff. The rural mail
carrier began leaving a 24-page yellow in every second
box. The hinds distrusted and detested the politics
of these great organs, but enjoyed their imbecilities.
The country weekly could not match the latter,
and so it began to decline. It is now in a low state
everywhere in America. Half of it is boiler-plate
and the other half is cross-roads gossip. The editor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
is no longer the leading thinker of his town; instead,
he is commonly a broken and despairing man, cadging
for advertisements and hoping for a political job.
He used to aspire to the State Senate; now he is
content with the post of town bailiff or road supervisor.</p>

<p>His place has been taken by the village pastor.
The pastor got into public affairs by the route of
Prohibition. The shrewd shysters who developed the
Anti-Saloon League made a politician of him, and
once he had got a taste of power he was eager for
more. It came very quickly. As industry penetrated
to the rural regions the new-blown Babbitts began
to sense his capacity for safeguarding the established
order, and so he was given the job: he became a
local Billy Sunday. And, simultaneously the old-line
politicians, taught a lesson by the Anti-Saloon
League, began to defer to him in general, as they had
yielded to him in particular. He was consulted
about candidacies; he had his say about policies.
The local school-board soon became his private preserve.
The wandering cony-catchers of the tin-pot
fraternal orders found him a useful man. He was,
by now, a specialist in all forms of public rectitude,
from teetotalism to patriotism. He was put up on
days of ceremony to sob for the flag, vice the county
judge, retired. When the Klan burst upon the peasants
all of his new duties were synthetized. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
obviously the chief local repository of its sublime
principles, theological, social, ethnological and patriotic.
In every country town in America to-day,
wherever the Klan continues to rowel the hinds, its
chief engine is a clerk in holy orders. If the Baptists
are strong, their pastor is that engine. Failing
Baptists, the heroic work is assumed by the Methodist
parson, or the Presbyterian, or the Campbellite.
Without these sacerdotal props the Invisible Empire
would have faded long ago.</p>

<p>What one mainly notices about these ambassadors
of Christ, observing them in the mass, is their vast
lack of sound information and sound sense. They
constitute, perhaps, the most ignorant class of teachers
ever set up to lead a civilized people; they are even
more ignorant than the county superintendents of
schools. Learning, indeed, is not esteemed in the
evangelical denominations, and any literate plowhand,
if the Holy Spirit inflames him, is thought to
be fit to preach. Is he commonly sent, as a preliminary,
to a training camp, to college? But what a
college! You will find one in every mountain valley
of the land, with its single building in its bare pasture
lot, and its faculty of half-idiot pedagogues and
broken-down preachers. One man, in such a college,
teaches oratory, ancient history, arithmetic
and Old Testament exegesis. The aspirant comes
in from the barnyard, and goes back in a year or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
two to the village. His body of knowledge is that of
a street-car motorman or a vaudeville actor. But he
has learned the clichés of his craft, and he has got
him a long-tailed coat, and so he has made his escape
from the harsh labors of his ancestors, and is set up as
a fountain of light and learning.</p>

<p>It is from such ignoramuses that the lower half of
American Protestantdom gets its view of the cosmos.
Certainly Fundamentalism should not be hard to
understand when its sources are inspected. How can
the teacher teach when his own head is empty? Of
all that constitutes the sum of human knowledge he
is as innocent as an Eskimo. Of the arts he knows
absolutely nothing; of the sciences he has never so
much as heard. No good book ever penetrates to
those remote “colleges,” nor does any graduate ever
take away a desire to read one. He has been warned,
indeed, against their blandishments; what is not addressed
solely to the paramount business of saving
souls is of the devil. So when he hears by chance of
the battle of ideas beyond the sky-rim, he quite naturally
puts it down to Beelzebub. What comes to him,
vaguely and distorted, is unintelligible to him. He
is suspicious of it, afraid of it—and he quickly communicates
his fears to his dupes. The common man,
in many ways, is hard to arouse; it is a terrific job to
ram even the most elemental ideas into him. But it
is always easy to scare him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>That is the daily business of the evangelical pastors
of the Republic. They are specialists in alarms
and bugaboos. The rum demon, atheists, Bolsheviki,
the Pope, bootleggers, the Jews,—all these have
served them in turn, and in the demonology of the
Ku Klux Klan all have been conveniently brought
together. The old stock company of devils has been
retired, and with it the old repertoire of private sins.
The American peasant of to-day finds it vastly easier
to claw into heaven than he used to. Personal holiness
has now been handed over to the Holy Rollers
and other such survivors from a harsher day. It is
sufficient now to hate the Pope, to hate the Jews, to
hate the scientists, to hate all foreigners, to hate
whatever the cities yield to. These hatreds have been
spread in the land by rev. pastors, chiefly Baptists
and Methodists. They constitute, with their attendant
fears, the basic religion of the American clod-hopper
to-day. They are the essence of the new Protestantism,
second division, American style.</p>

<p>Their public effects are constantly underestimated
until it is too late. I ask no indulgence for calling
attention to the case of Prohibition. Fundamentalism,
it may be, is sneaking upon the nation in the same
disarming way. The cities laugh at the yokels, but
meanwhile the politicians take careful notice; such
mountebanks as Peay of Tennessee and Blease of
South Carolina have already issued their preliminary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
whoops. As the tide rolls up the pastors will attain
to greater and greater consequence. Already, indeed,
they swell visibly in power and pretension.
The Klan, in its earlier days, kept them discreetly
under cover; they labored valiantly in the hold, but
only lay go-getters were seen upon the bridge. But
now they are everywhere on public display, leading
the anthropoid host. The curious thing is that their
activity gets little if any attention from the established
publicists. Let a lone Red arise to annoy a barroom
full of Michigan lumber-jacks, and at once
the fire-alarm sounds and the full military and naval
power of the nation is summoned to put down the
outrage. But how many Americans would the Reds
convert to their rubbish, even supposing them free
to spout it on every street-corner? Probably not
enough, all told, to make a day’s hunting for a regiment
of militia. The American moron’s mind simply
does not run in that direction; he wants to keep his
Ford, even at the cost of losing the Bill of Rights.
But the stuff that the Baptist and Methodist dervishes
have on tap is very much to his taste; he gulps it
eagerly and rubs his tummy. I suggest that it might
be well to make a scientific inquiry into the nature
of it. The existing agencies of sociological snooting
seem to be busy in other directions. There are elaborate
surveys of some of the large cities, showing
how much it costs to teach a child the principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
of Americanism, how often the average citizen falls
into the hands of the cops, how many detective stories
are taken out of the city library daily, and how many
children a normal Polish woman has every year.
Why not a survey of the rustic areas, where men are
he and God still reigns? Why not an attempt to find
out just what the Baptist dominies have drilled into
the heads of the Tennesseeans, Arkansans and Nebraskans?
It would be amusing, and it would be instructive.
And useful. For it is well, in such matters,
to see clearly what is ahead. The United States
grows increasingly urban, but its ideas are still
hatched in the little towns. What the swineherds
credit to-day is whooped to-morrow by their agents
and attorneys in Congress, and then comes upon the
cities suddenly, with all the force of law. Where do
the swineherds get it? Mainly from the only publicists
and metaphysicians they know: the gentlemen of
the sacred faculty. It was not the bawling of the
mountebank Bryan, but the sermon of a mountain
Bossuet that laid the train of the Scopes case and
made a whole State forever ridiculous. I suggest
looking more carefully into the notions that such
ignoramuses spout.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what is the effect of all this upon the
Protestant who retains some measure of sanity, the
moderate and peaceable fellow—him called by William
Graham Sumner the Forgotten Man? He is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
silent while the bombs burst and the stink bombs go
off, but what is he thinking? I believe that he is
thinking strange and dreadful thoughts—thoughts
that would have frozen his own spine a dozen years
ago. He is thinking, <i>imprimis</i>, that there must be
something in this evolution heresy after all, else Methodist
bishops and other such bristling foes to sense
would not be so frantically against it. And he is
thinking, secondly, that perhaps a civilized man,
in the last analysis, would not be worse off if Sherman’s
march were repeated by the Papal Guard.
Between these two thoughts American Protestantism
is being squeezed, so to speak, to death.</p>

<i>Counter-Offensive</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>IS IT GOD’S WORD? by Joseph Wheless. New York: <i>Alfred
A. Knopf</i>. [The American Mercury, May, 1926.]</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE author of this book, who is an associate
editor of the <i>American Bar Association
Journal</i>, was trained as a lawyer, but that
training, somewhat surprisingly, seems to have left
his logical powers unimpaired, and with them his
capacity for differentiating between facts and mere
appearances. There is no hint of the usual evasions
and obfuscations of the advocate in his pages. His
business is to examine calmly the authority and plausibility
of Holy Writ, both as history and as revelation
of the Omnipotent Will, and to that business he
brings an immense and meticulous knowledge, an
exact and unfailing judicial sense, and a skill at
orderly exposition which is quite extraordinary.
There is no vaporing of the orthodox exegetes that
he is not familiar with, and none that he fails to
refute, simply and devastatingly. Nine-tenths of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
evidence he takes out of the mouths of his opponents.
Patiently, mercilessly, irresistibly, he subjects it to
logical analysis, and when he is done at last—his
book runs to 494 pages of fine print—there is little
left of the two Testaments save a farrago of palpable
nonsense, swathed, to be sure, in very lovely
poetry. He exposes all their gross and preposterous
contradictions, their violations of common sense and
common decency, their grotesque collisions with the
known and indubitable facts, their petty tergiversations
and fraudulences. He goes behind the mellifluous
rhetoric of the King James Version to the
harsh balderdash of the originals, and brings it out
into the horrible light of day. He exposes the prophecies
that have failed to come off. He exhibits the
conflicts of romantic and unreliable witnesses, most
of them with something to sell. He tracks down ideas
to their barbaric sources. He concocts an almost
endless series of logical dilemmas. And he does it
all with good manners, never pausing to rant and
nowhere going beyond the strict letter of the record.</p>

<p>Obviously, there is room and need for such a book,
and it deserves to be widely read. For in the America
of to-day, after a time of quiescence, the old conflict
between religion and science has been resumed
with great ferocity, and the partisans of the former,
not content with denouncing all free inquiry as evil,
have now undertaken to make it downright unlawful.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
Worse, they show signs of succeeding. And why?
Chiefly, it seems to me, because the cause of their
opponents has been badly handled—above all, because
it has lacked vigorous <i>offensive</i> leadership.
Even the defense is largely an abject running away.
We are assured with pious snuffling that there is actually
no conflict, that the domains of science and religion
do not overlap, that it is quite possible for a
man to be a scientist (even a biologist!) and yet believe
that Jonah swallowed the whale. No wonder
the whoopers for Genesis take courage, and lay on
with glad, <i>sforzando</i> shouts. At one stroke they are
lifted to parity with their opponents, nay, to superiority.
The bilge they believe in becomes something
sacrosanct; its manifest absurdities are not
mentioned, and hence tend to pass unnoticed. But
meanwhile they are quite free to belabor science with
their whole armamentarium of imbecilities. Every
cross-roads Baptist preacher becomes an authority
upon its errors, and is heard gravely. In brief,
science exposes itself to be shot at, but agrees not to
shoot back. It would be difficult to imagine any
strategy more idiotic.</p>

<p>Or to imagine a Huxley adopting it. Huxley, in
his day, followed a far different plan. When the
Gladstones, Bishop Wilberforces and other such obscurantists
denounced the new biology, he did not
waste any time upon conciliatory politeness. Instead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
he made a bold and headlong attack upon
Christian theology—an attack so vigorous and so
skillful that the enemy was soon in ignominious
flight. Huxley knew the first principle of war: he
knew that a hearty offensive is worth a hundred defensives.
How well he succeeded is shown by the
fact that even to-day, with theology once more on the
prowl and the very elements of science under heavy
attack, some of the gaudiest of the ancient theological
notions are not heard of. Huxley disposed of them
completely; even in Darkest Tennessee the yokels no
longer give them credit. But if the Robert Andrews
Millikans and other such amiable bunglers continue
to boss the scientific camp you may be sure that all
these exploded myths and superstitions will be revived,
and that the mob will once more embrace them.
For it is the natural tendency of the ignorant to
believe what is not true. In order to overcome that
tendency it is not sufficient to exhibit the true; it is
also necessary to expose and denounce the false. To
admit that the false has any standing in court, that
it ought to be handled gently because millions of
morons cherish it and thousands of quacks make
their livings propagating it—to admit this, as the
more fatuous of the reconcilers of science and religion
inevitably do, is to abandon a just cause to its
enemies, cravenly and without excuse.</p>

<p>It is, of course, quite true that there is a region<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
in which science and religion do not conflict. That
is the region of the unknowable. No one knows Who
created the visible universe, and it is infinitely improbable
that anything properly describable as evidence
on the point will ever be discovered. No one
knows what motives or intentions, if any, lie behind
what we call natural laws. No one knows why man
has his present form. No one knows why sin and
suffering were sent into this world—that is, why the
fashioning of man was so badly botched. Naturally
enough, all these problems have engaged the interest
of humanity since the remotest days, and in every
age, with every sort of evidence completely lacking,
men of speculative mind have sought to frame plausible
solutions. Some of them, more bold than the
rest, have pretended that their solutions were revealed
to them by God, and multitudes have believed them.
But no man of science believes them. He doesn’t say
positively that they are wrong; he simply says that
there is no proof that they are right. If he admitted,
without proof, that they are right, he would not be
a man of science. In his view all such theories and
speculations stand upon a common level. In the most
ambitious soarings of a Christian theologian he can
find nothing that differs in any essential way from
the obvious hocus-pocus of a medicine man in the
jungle. Superficially, of course, the two stand far
apart. The Christian theologian, confined like all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
the rest to the unknowable, has to be more careful than
the medicine man, for in Christendom the unknowable
covers a far less extensive field than in the
jungle. Christian theology is thus, in a sense, more
reasonable than voodooism. But it is not more
reasonable because its professors know more than the
voodoo-man about the unknowable; it is more reasonable
simply because they are under a far more rigorous
and enlightened scrutiny, and run a risk of
being hauled up sharply every time they venture too
near the borders of the known.</p>

<p>This business of hauling them up is one of the principal
functions of science. Its prompt execution is the
gauge of a high and progressive civilization. So long
as theologians keep within their proper bounds, science
has no quarrel with them, for it is no more able
to prove that they are wrong than they themselves are
able to prove that they are right. But human experience
shows that they never keep within their
proper bounds voluntarily; they are always bulging
over the line, and making a great uproar over things
that they know nothing about. Such an uproar is
going on in the United States at the present moment.
Hordes of theologians come marching down from
the Southern mountains, declaring raucously that God
created the universe during a certain single week of
the year 4004 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, and demanding that all persons
who presume to doubt it be handed over to the secular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
arm. Here, obviously, science cannot suffer
them gladly, nor even patiently. Their proposition
is a statement of scientific fact; it may be examined
and tested like any other statement of scientific fact.
So examined and tested, it turns out to be wholly without
evidential support. All the known evidence, indeed,
is against it, and overwhelmingly. No man
who knows the facts—that is, no man with any claim
to scientific equipment—is in any doubt about that.
He disbelieves it as thoroughly as he believes that
the earth moves ’round the sun. Disbelieving it, it
is his professional duty, his first obligation of professional
honor, to attack and refute those who uphold
it. Above all, it is his duty to attack the false evidence
upon which they base their case.</p>

<p>Thus an actual conflict is joined, and it is the
height of absurdity for the Millikans and other such
compromisers to seek to evade it with soft words.
That conflict was not begun by science. It did not
start with an invasion of the proper field of theological
speculation by scientific raiders. It started with
an invasion of the field of science by theological raiders.
Now that it is on, it must be pressed vigorously
from the scientific side, and without any flabby tenderness
for theological susceptibilities. A defensive war
is not enough; there must be a forthright onslaught
upon the theological citadel, and every effort must
be made to knock it down. For so long as it remains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
a stronghold, there will be no security for sound sense
among us, and little for common decency. So long
as it may be used as a recruiting-station and rallying-point
for the rabble, science will have to submit to
incessant forays, and the same forays will be directed
against every sort of rational religion. The
latter danger is not unobserved by the more enlightened
theologians. They are well aware that, facing
the Fundamentalists, they must either destroy or be
destroyed. It is to be hoped that the men of science
will perceive the same plain fact, and so give over
their vain effort to stay the enemy with weasel words.</p>

<p>ALTGELD OF ILLINOIS, by Waldo R. Browne, New York:
<i>B. W. Huebsch</i>. THE LAST OF THE HERETICS, by Algernon
Sidney Crapsey. New York: <i>Alfred A. Knopf</i>. [The American
Mercury, October, 1924.]</p>
</div>

<p>When I was a boy, in the early nineties of the last
century, the reigning hobgoblin of the United States
was John P. Altgeld, Governor of Illinois. From this
distance the ill-fame that played about him seems
almost fabulous. He was a sort of horrendous combination
of Trotsky and Raisuli, Darwin and the
German Crown Prince, Jesse James and Oscar Wilde,
with overtones of Wayne B. Wheeler and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
McNamara brothers. We have had, in these later
years, no such communal devil. The La Follette of
1917 was a popular favorite compared to him; the
Debs of the same time was a spoiled darling. What
I gathered from my elders, in the awful years of
adolescence, when my voice began to break and vibrissæ
sprouted on my lip, was that Altgeld was a
shameless advocate of rapine and assassination, an
enemy alike to the Constitution and the Ten Commandments—in
short, a bloody and insatiable anarchist.
I was thus bred to fear him even more than
I feared the anonymous scoundrels who had stolen
Charlie Ross. When I dreamed, it was of catching
him in some public place and cutting off his head,
to the applause of the multitude.</p>

<p>The elders that I have mentioned were mainly business
men, with a few <i>Gelehrte</i> thrown in. I learned
later on, by hard experience, that the opinions of such
gentlemen, particularly of public matters and public
men, were not always sound. Nevertheless, I continued
to have a bilious suspicion of the Hon. Mr.
Altgeld, and it survived even the discovery, made
much later, that men who had actually known him—for
example, Theodore Dreiser—regarded him very
highly. I remember very well how shocked I was
when Dreiser made me privy to this fact. It made
a dent, I suppose, in my old view, but it surely did
not dispose of it altogether. I continued to believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
that Altgeld, though perhaps not an anarchist, as
alleged, was at least a blathering Socialist, and hence
deserving of a few prophylactic kicks in the pantaloons.
I was far gone in my forties before ever I got
at the truth. Then I found it in this modest book
of Mr. Browne’s—a volume that is dreadfully written,
but extremely illuminating. That truth may be put
very simply. Altgeld was not an anarchist, nor was
he a Socialist: he was simply a sentimentalist. His
error consisted in taking the college yells of democracy
seriously.</p>

<p>I do not go into the evidence, but refer you to
the book. It is very completely documented, and it
leaves little room for doubt, despite Mr. Browne’s
obvious prejudice in favor of some of Altgeld’s more
dubious ideas, especially the idea of government
ownership. On the main points his argument is quite
beyond cavil. Did Altgeld pardon the Chicago
anarchists? Then it was simply because they had
been railroaded to jail on evidence that should have
made the very judge on the bench guffaw—as men
are still railroaded in California to-day. Did he protest
against Cleveland’s invasion of Chicago with
Federal troops at the time of the Pullman strike?
Then it was because he knew only too well how little
they were needed—and what sinister influences had
cajoled poor old Grover into sending them. In brief,
Altgeld was one of the first public men in America to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
protest by word and act against government by usurers
and their bashi-bazouks—the first open and
avowed advocate of the Bill of Rights since Jackson’s
time. A romantic fellow, and a firm believer in the
virtues of the common people, he couldn’t rid himself
of the delusion that they would follow him here—that
after the yell of rage there would come a resounding
cheer. That belief gradually degenerated into
a hope, but I doubt that it ever disappeared altogether.
The common people met it by turning Altgeld out of
office, swiftly and ignominiously. After they had got
rid of him as Governor of Illinois, they even rejected
him as mayor of Chicago. His experience taught
him a lesson, but like that of the Aframerican on the
gallows, it came too late.</p>

<p>What lesson is in his career for the rest of us?
The lesson, it seems to me, that any man who devotes
himself to justice and common decency, under
democracy, is a very foolish fellow—that the generality
of men have no genuine respect for these
things, and are always suspicious of the man who
upholds them. Their public relations, like their
private relations, are marked by the qualities that
mark the inferior man at all times and everywhere:
cowardice, stupidity and cruelty. They are in favor
of whoever is wielding the whip, even when their own
hides must bear the blows. How easy it was to turn
the morons of the American Legion upon their fellow-slaves!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span> 
How heroically they voted for Harding, and
then for Coolidge after him—and so helped to put
down the Reds! Dog eats dog, world without end.
In the Pullman strike at least half the labor unions
of the United States were against the strikers, as
they were against the more recent steel strikers, and
helped to beat them. Altgeld battled for the under
dog all his life—and the under dog bit him in the
end. A pathetic career, but not without its touches
of sardonic comedy. Altgeld, in error at bottom, was
often also in error on the surface, and not infrequently
somewhat grotesquely. He succumbed to the
free silver mania. He supported Bryan—nay more,
he may be said to have discovered and made Bryan.
It is fortunate for him that he was dead and in hell
by 1902, and so not forced to contemplate the later
states of his handiwork. He was excessively romantic,
but certainly no ignoramus. Imagine him listening
to one of good Jennings’ harangues against the
elements of biology! Such men, indeed, are always
happier dead. This world, and especially this
Republic, is no place for idealists.</p>

<p>Another proof of it is offered by the career of
Dr. Crapsey, whose trial for heresy entertained the
damned in 1906. He is still alive as I write, and
still full of steam. But I doubt that he is as sure as
he used to be that common sense and common honesty
pay. Many of the frauds who drove him out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
the church, though they knew that he was right, are
bishops to-day, and licensed to bind and loose.
Others have been called by God, and sit upon His
right hand. The church itself, as it has grown more
sordid and swinish, has only grown more prosperous.
In New York City its income approaches that of the
bootleggers and it is almost as well regarded.
Every new profiteer, even before he tries to horn into
the Piping Rock Club, subscribes to its articles. It
is robbing the Church of Christ Scientist of all the
rich Jews; they are having their sons baptized in
its fonts and christened Llewellyn, Seymour and
Murray. Certainly it would be difficult to imagine
a more gloriously going concern. The rising spires
of its steel and concrete cathedrals begin to bulge
the floor of heaven; its clergy are sleek, fat and
well-oiled; its bishops come next in precedence after
movie stars and members of the firm of J. P. Morgan
&amp; Company. Lately it threw out another heretic—like
Dr. Crapsey, one accused of putting the Sermon
on the Mount above the conflicting genealogies of
the Preacher. As for Crapsey himself, he has naught
to console him in his old age save the thought that
hell will at least be warm.</p>

<p>His book is extremely amusing and instructive.
Like Altgeld, he confesses to foreign and poisonous
blood. The <i>Stammvater</i> of the American Crapseii
was a fellow named Kropps, apparently a Hessian.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
But his great-great grandson, the father of the heretic,
married the daughter of a United States Senator, and
so there is some amelioration of the horror. Like
Altgeld again, Crapsey went to the Civil War as a
boy scarcely out of knee breeches. Altgeld was so
poor that he gladly took the $100 offered by a patriot
who had been drafted and wanted a substitute;
Crapsey volunteered. Both succumbed to camp
fevers and were discharged. Both then took to
Service among the downtrodden, Altgeld in politics
and the law, and Crapsey in one of the outlying
hereditaments of Trinity parish. Both were safe so
long as they appeared to be fraudulent; the moment
they began to show genuine belief in their doctrines
they found themselves in difficulties. So Altgeld
became the favorite hobgoblin of the Republic and
Crapsey became its blackest heretic.</p>

<i>The Grove of Academe</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>THE GOOSE-STEP, by Upton Sinclair, Pasadena, Calif.: <i>Published
by the Author</i>. [The Smart Set, May, 1923.]</p>
</div>

<p>The doctrine preached in this fat volume—to wit,
that the American colleges and universities, with
precious few exceptions, are run by stock-jobbers
and manned by intellectual prostitutes—this doctrine
will certain give no fillip of surprise to steady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
readers of my critical compositions. I have, in fact,
maintained it steadily since the earliest dawn of the
present marvelous century, and to the support of
it I have brought forward an immense mass of glittering
and irrefragable facts and a powerful stream
of eloquence. Nor have I engaged in this moral
enterprise <i>a cappella</i>. A great many other practitioners
have devoted themselves to it with equal assiduity,
including not a few reformed and conscience-stricken
professors, and the net result of that united effort
is that the old assumption of the pedagogue’s <i>bona
fides</i> is now in decay throughout the Republic. In
whole departments of human knowledge he has become
suspect, as it were, <i>ex officio</i>. I nominate, for
example, the departments of history and of what is
commonly called English language and literature.
If a professor in the first field shows ordinary honesty,
or, in the second field, ordinary sense, it is now
regarded as a sort of marvel, and with sound reason.
Barring a scant dozen extraordinary men, no American
professor of history has written anything worth
reading since the year 1917; nearly all the genuine
history published in the United States since then
has come from laymen, or from professors who have
ceased to profess. And so in the domain of the
national letters. The professors, with a few exceptions,
mainly belated rice-converts, are unanimously
and furiously consecrated to vain attacks upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
literature that is in being. Either, like the paleozoic
Beers, of Yale, they refuse to read it and deny that it
exists, or, like the patriotic Matthews, of Columbia,
they seek to put it down by launching Ku Klux
anathemas against it. The net result is that the professorial
caste, as a whole, loses all its old dignity
and influence. In universities large and small, East,
West, North and South, the very sophomores rise in
rebellion against the incompetence and imbecility of
their preceptors, and in the newspapers the professor
slides down gradually to the level of a chiropractor,
a press-agent or a Congressman.</p>

<p>Thus there is nothing novel in the thesis of Dr.
Sinclair’s book, which deals, in brief, with the internal
organization of the American universities, and their
abject subjection to the Money Power, which is to say,
to Chamber of Commerce and Rotary Club concepts
of truth, liberty and honor. But there is something
new, and very refreshing, in the manner of it, for
the learned author, for the first time, manages to tell
a long and dramatic story without intruding his private
grievances into it. Sinclair’s worst weakness,
next to his vociferous appetite for Remedies that never
cure, is his naïve and almost actorial vanity. As
everyone knows, it botched “The Brass Check.” So
much of that book was given over to a humorless
account of his own combats with yellow journals—which,
in the main, did nothing worse to him than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
laugh at him when he was foolish—that he left untold
a great deal that might have been said, and with perfect
justice and accuracy, about the venality and swinishness
of American newspapers. In “The Profits of
Religion” he wobbled almost as badly; the subject,
no doubt, was much too vast for a single volume; the
Methodists and Baptists alone, to say nothing of Holy
Church, deserved a whole shelf. But in “The Goose-Step”
he tells a straightforward story in a straightforward
manner—simply, good-humoredly and convincingly.
When he comes into the narrative himself,
which is not often, he leaves off his customary martyr’s
chemise. There is no complaining, no pathos,
no mouthing of platitude; it is a plain record of plain
facts, with names and dates—a plain record of truly
appalling cowardice, disingenuousness, abjectness,
and degradation. Out of it two brilliant figures
emerge: first the typical American university president,
a jenkins to wealth, an ignominious waiter in
antechambers and puller of wires, a politician, a
fraud and a cad; and secondly, the typical American
professor, a puerile and pitiable slave.</p>

<p>Such are the common and customary bearers of
the torch in the Republic. Such is the usual machinery
and inner nature of the higher learning among
us. Its aim, briefly stated, is almost indistinguishable
from the aim of the Ku Klux Klan, the American
Legion, and Kiwanis. The thing it combats most ardently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
is not ignorance, but free inquiry; it is devoted
to forcing the whole youth of the land into one rigid
mold. Its ideal product is a young man who is absolutely
correct in all his ideas—a perfect reader
for the <i>Literary Digest</i>, the <i>American Magazine</i>, and
the editorial page of the New York <i>Times</i>. To
achieve this end Big Business has endowed it with
unprecedented liberality; there are single American
universities with more invested wealth and more income
than all the universities of Germany, France
or England taken together. But in order to get that
ocean of money, and to pay for the piles of pseudo-Gothic
that now arise all over the land, scholarship
in America has had to sacrifice free inquiry to the
prejudices and private interests of its masters—the
search for the truth has had to be subordinated to
the safeguarding of railway bonds and electric light
stocks. As Sinclair shows, there is scarcely a university
in the United States, whether maintained out of
the public funds or privately endowed, that is not
run absolutely, in all departments, by precisely the
same men who run the street railways, the banks, the
rolling-mills, the coal mines and the factories of the
country—in brief, by men who have no more respect
for scholarship than an ice-wagon driver has for
beautiful letters. There is scarcely an American
university or college in which the scholars who constitute
it have any effective control over its general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
policies and enterprises, or even over the conduct
of their own departments. In almost every one there
is some unspeakable stockbroker, or bank director,
or railway looter who, if the spirit moved him, would
be perfectly free to hound a Huxley, a Karl Ludwig
or a Jowett from the faculty, and even to prevent him
getting a seemly berth elsewhere. It is not only
possible; it has been done, and not once, but scores
and hundreds of times.</p>

<p>Sinclair is content to set forth the basic facts; his
book, as it is, is very long; he neglects laboring all
of the deductions and implications that flow from his
thesis, some of them obvious enough. One of them
is this: that the control of the universities by Mr.
Babbitt is making it increasingly difficult to induce
intelligent and self-respecting young men to embrace
the birchman’s career, and that the personnel of the
teaching staffs thus tends to decline in competence,
steadily and sharply. This accounts, in large measure,
for the collapse of the old public influence of
the scholar in America; he begins to be derided
simply because he is no longer the dignified man that
he once was. In certain departments, of no immediate
interest to trustees and contributors, a certain
show of freedom, of course, still prevails. What
is taught in astronomy, or paleontology, or Greek
cannot menace the nail manufacturer on the board,
and so he does not issue any orders about it, nor does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
his agent, the university president. But what is
taught in economics, or modern history, or “education,”
or sociology, or even literature, involves a
dealing with ideas that are apt to hit him where he
lives, and so he keeps a wary eye upon those departments,
and at the slightest show of heresy he takes
measures to protect himself. It is in these regions,
consequently, that conformity is most comfortable,
and that professional character is most lamentably in
decay. Even here, to be sure, a few stout-hearted
survivors of an earlier day hold out, but they are
surely not many, and they will have no successors.
The professor of to-morrow, in all departments that
have to do with life as men are now living it in the
world, will either be a scholastic goose-stepper or he
will be out of a job. The screws are tightening every
year. In the past the Babbitts have contented themselves
with farming out the management of their intellectual
brothels to extra-plaint professors, but now
they begin to turn to yet more reliable men: army
officers, lame-duck politicians, and engineers. The
time will come, no doubt, when the president of
Columbia will be just as frankly a partner in J. P.
Morgan &amp; Company as the head of the Red Cross
or the chief vestryman of Trinity Church.</p>

<p>How far will this debauching of education go?
Will the universities sink eventually to the level of
the public-schools of such barbarous States as Texas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
Arkansas and Mississippi? Here education has been
reduced to a bald device for multiplying Shriners,
Knights of Pythias and Rotarians—in brief, ignoramuses.
In the institutions of higher learning one
may reasonably look for some resistance to the process,
soon or late. I doubt, however, that it will come
from the professors; they are already too much cowed
and demoralized, as Sinclair shows abundantly. The
American Association of University Professors, an
organization formed to protect pedagogues against
wanton attack by the Babbitts, numbers but 5000
members; the remaining 195,000 American professors
are either afraid to join, or already too much
battered to want to. How far their degradation has
gone was made visible during the late war, when all
save an infinitesimal minority of them yielded to the
most extravagant manias of the time and thousands
gave astounding exhibitions of moronic sadism. The
Neandertal qualities thus awakened are still visible
in many directions; in the Southern States, I am informed
by an exceptional professor, fully five-sixths
of his colleagues became charter members of the Ku
Klux Klan. It is hopeless to look for a <i>Freiheitskrieg</i>
among such poor serfs. But the students remain,
and in them lies some promise for the future.
The American university student, in the past, has
been a victim of the same process of leveling that destroyed
his teacher. He has been taught conformity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
obedience, the social and intellectual goose-step; the
ideal held before him has been the ideal of correctness.
But that ideal, it must be plain, is not natural
to youth. Youth is aspiring, rebellious, inquisitive,
iconoclastic, a bit romantic. All over the country
the fact is bursting through the chains of repression.
In scores of far-flung colleges the students have begun
to challenge their professors, often very harshly.
After a while, they may begin to challenge the masters
of their professors. Not all of them will do it, and
not most of them. But it doesn’t take a majority to
make a rebellion; it takes only a few determined
leaders and a sound cause.</p>

<i>The Schoolma’m’s Goal</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>THE SOCIAL OBJECTIVES OF SCHOOL ENGLISH, by Charles
S. Pendleton. Nashville, Tenn.: <i>Published by the Author</i>. [The
American Mercury, March, 1925.]</p>
</div>

<p>Here, in the form of a large flat book, eight and a
half inches wide and eleven inches tall, is a sight-seeing
bus touring the slums of pedagogy. The
author, Dr. Pendleton, professes the teaching of
English (not English, remember, but the teaching of
English) at the George Peabody College for Teachers,
an eminent seminary at Nashville, in the Baptist Holy
Land, and his object in the investigation he describes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
was, in brief, to find out what the teachers who teach
English hope to accomplish by teaching it. In other
words, what, precisely, is the improvement that they
propose to achieve in the pupils exposed to their art
and mystery? Do they believe that the aim of teaching
English is to increase the exact and beautiful use
of the language? Or that it is to inculcate and augment
patriotism? Or that it is to diminish sorrow
in the home? Or that it has some other end, cultural,
economic or military?</p>

<p>In order to find out, Prof. Pendleton, with true
pedagogical diligence, proceeded to list all the
reasons for teaching English that he could find.
Some he got by cross-examining teachers. Others
came from educators of a higher degree and puissance.
Yet others he dug out of the text-books of
pedagogy in common use, and the dreadful professional
journals ordinarily read by teachers. Finally,
he threw in some from miscellaneous sources, including
his own inner consciousness. In all, he accumulated
1581 such reasons, or, as he calls them, objectives,
and then he sat down and laboriously copied
them upon 1581 very thin 3×5 cards, one to a card.
Some of these cards were buff in color, some were
blue, some were yellow, some were pink, and some
were green. On the blue cards he copied all the
objectives relating to the employment of English in
conversation, on the yellow cards all those dealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
with its use in literary composition, on the green
cards all those having to do with speech-making, and
so on. Then he shook up the cards, summoned eighty
professional teachers of English, and asked them to
sort out the objectives in the order of appositeness
and merit. The results of this laborious sorting he
now sets before the learned.</p>

<p>Don’t be impatient! I won’t keep you waiting.
Here is the objective that got the most votes—the
champion of the whole 1581:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The ability to spell correctly without hesitation all the
ordinary words of one’s writing vocabulary.</p>
</div>

<p>Here is the runner-up:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The ability to speak, in conversation, in complete sentences,
not in broken phrases.</p>
</div>

<p>And here is No. 7:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The ability to capitalize speedily and accurately in one’s
writing.</p>
</div>

<p>And here is No. 9:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The ability to think quickly in an emergency.</p>
</div>

<p>And here are some more, all within the first
hundred:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The ability to refrain from marking or marring in any
way a borrowed book.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>An attitude of democracy rather than snobbishness within
a conversation.</p>

<p>Familiarity with the essential stories and persons of the
Bible.</p>
</div>

<p>And some from the second hundred:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The ability to sing through—words and music—the national
anthem.</p>

<p>The ability courteously and effectively to receive orders
from a superior.</p>

<p>The avoidance of vulgarity and profanity in one’s public
speaking.</p>

<p>The ability to read silently without lip movements.</p>

<p>The habit of placing the page one is reading so that
there will not be shadows upon it.</p>

<p>The ability to refrain from conversation under conditions
where it is annoying or disagreeable to others.</p>

<p>The ability to converse intelligently about municipal and
district civic matters.</p>

<p>The ability to comprehend accurately the meaning of
all common abbreviations and signs one meets with in reading.</p>

<p>The ability, during one’s reading, to distinguish between
an author’s central theme and his incidental remarks.</p>
</div>

<p>I refrain from any more: all these got enough votes
to put them among the first 200 objectives—200 out
of 1581. Nor do I choose them unfairly; most of
those that I have not listed were quite as bad as those
I have. But, you may protest, the good professor
handed his cards to a jury of little girls of eight or
nine years, or to the inmates of a home for the feeble-minded!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> 
He did, in fact, nothing of the kind. His
jury was very carefully selected. It consisted of
eighty teachers of such professional keenness that
they were assembled at the University of Chicago for
post-graduate study. Every one of them had been
through either a college or a normal school; forty-seven
of them held learned degrees; all of them had
been engaged professionally in teaching English,
some for years. They came from Michigan, Nebraska,
Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Toronto, Leland
Stanford, Chicago and Northwestern Universities;
from Oberlin, De Pauw, Goucher, Beloit and Drake
Colleges; from a dozen lesser seminaries of the higher
learning. They represented, not the lowest level of
teachers of English in the Republic, but the highest
level. And yet it was their verdict by a solemn
referendum that the principal objective in teaching
English was to make good spellers, and that after that
came the breeding of good capitalizers!</p>

<p>I present Dr. Pendleton’s laborious work as overwhelming
proof of a thesis that I have maintained
for years, perhaps sometimes with undue heat: that
pedagogy in the United States is fast descending to
the estate of a childish necromancy, and that the
worst idiots, even among pedagogues, are the teachers
of English. It is positively dreadful to think that the
young American species are exposed day in and day
out to the contamination of such dark minds. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
can be expected of education that is carried on in the
very sewers of the intellect? How can morons teach
anything that is worth knowing? Here and there,
true enough, a competent teacher of English is encountered.
I could name at least twenty in the whole
country. But it does not appear that Dr. Pendleton,
among his eighty, found even one. There is not the
lightest glimmer of intelligence in all the appalling
tables of statistics and black, zig-zag graphs that
he has so painfully amassed. Nor any apparent
capacity for learning. The sound thing, the sane
thing and the humane thing to do with his pathetic
herd of A. B.’s would be to take them out in the alley
and knock them in the head.</p>

<i>The Heroic Age</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>JEFFERSON AND HAMILTON, by Claude G. Bowers. Boston:
<i>The Houghton Mifflin Company</i>. JEFFERSON AND MONTICELLO,
by Paul Wilstach. Garden City, L. I.: <i>Doubleday, Page
&amp; Company</i>. CORRESPONDENCE OF JOHN ADAMS AND
THOMAS JEFFERSON, 1812-1826, selected by Paul Wilstach.
Indianapolis: <i>The Bobbs-Merrill Company</i>. [The American Mercury,
March, 1926.]</p>
</div>

<p>Jefferson, in one of his last letters to Adams, dated
March 25, 1826, spoke of the time when both came
into fame as the heroic age. The phrase was certainly
not mere rhetoric. The two men differed enormously,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
both in their personalities and in their ideas—perhaps
quite as much as Jefferson differed from
Hamilton or Adams from his cousin Sam—but in
one thing at least they were exactly alike: they were
men of complete integrity. As Frederick the Great
said of the Prussian <i>Junker</i>, one could not buy them,
and they would not lie. The fact, at times, made
them bitter enemies, and the virtues of the one were
cancelled by the virtues of the other, to the damage of
their common country. But when they stood together,
they were irresistible, for complete integrity,
when it does not spend itself against itself, is always
irresistible—one of the few facts, to me known, that
is creditable to the human race. The masses of men,
like children, are easily deceived, but in the long run,
like children again, they show a tendency to yield
to character. Bit by bit it conquers them. They see
in it all the high values that they are incapable of
reaching themselves. They see the courage that they
lack, and the honesty that they lack, and the resolution
that they lack. All these things were in both
Adams and Jefferson. They fell, in their day, into
follies, but I don’t think that anyone believes they
were ever <i>pushed</i> into them. Adams, no doubt,
could be bamboozled, but neither he nor Jefferson
could be scared.</p>

<p>I fear that the gallant iconoclasts who revise our
history-books sometimes forget all this. Engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
upon the destruction of legends, all of them maudlin
and many of them downright insane, they also, at
times, do damage to facts. One of these facts, it
seems to me, ought not to be forgotten, to wit, that it
took a great deal of courage, in the Summer of 1776,
to sign Jefferson’s celebrated exercise in colonial
Johnsonese. There were ropes dangling in the air,
and they were uncomfortably near. There were
wives and children to be considered, and very agreeable
estates. However dubious their primary motives,
the men who signed took a long chance, quietly,
simply, and with their faces to the front. How many
of their successors in our own time have ever followed
their example? I find it hard to think of one.
The politician of to-day lacks their courage altogether;
he lacks their incorruptible integrity. He is
a complete coward. The whip of the Anti-Saloon
League is enough to make him leap and tremble; the
shadow of the rope would paralyze him with terror.
He is for sale to anyone who has anything valuable
to offer him, and the day after he has sold out to A
he is ready to sell out to A’s enemy, B. His honor
is that of a street-walker.</p>

<p>So far we have progressed along the highroad of
democracy. The gentleman survives in our politics
only as an anachronism; his day is done. Mr.
Bowers, in “Hamilton and Jefferson,” traces the beginning
of the decline; Mr. Wilstach, in the volume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
of Adams-Jefferson letters, shows it in full tide.
Both authors are partial to Jefferson, and present
charming portraits of him, especially Mr. Wilstach,
in his other book, “Jefferson at Monticello.” It
seems to me that they often confuse the man and his
ideas, especially Mr. Bowers. Jefferson was unquestionably
one of our giants. There was more in his
head than there has been in the heads of all the Presidents
in office since he went out. He was a man of
immense intellectual curiosity, profound originality,
and great daring. His integrity was of Doric massiveness.
But was he always right? I don’t think
many reflective Americans of to-day would argue that
he was. Confronting enemies of great resourcefulness
and resolute determination, he was forced, bit
by bit, into giving his democratic doctrine a sweep
and scope that took it far beyond the solid facts. It
became a religious dogma rather than a political
theory. Once he was gone, it fell into the hands of
vastly inferior men, and soon it had reached its
<i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. Jefferson died in 1826. By
1829, when Jackson came in, it was a nuisance; by
1837, when he went out, it was a joke.</p>

<p>Jefferson’s enthusiasm blinded him to the fact that
the liberty to which he had consecrated the high days
of his early manhood was a two-headed boon. There
was, first, the liberty of the people as a whole to determine
the forms of their own government, levy their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
own taxes, and make their own laws—in brief, freedom
from the despotism of the King. There was,
second, the liberty of the individual man to live his
own life, within the limits of decency and decorum,
as he pleased—in brief, freedom from the despotism
of the majority. Hamilton was as much in favor of
the first kind of liberty as Jefferson: he made, in fact,
even greater sacrifices for it. But he saw that it was
worth nothing without the second kind—that it might
easily become worth less than nothing, for the King,
whatever his oppressions <i>en gros</i>, at least gave some
protection to the isolated subject. Monarchy might
be the protector of liberty as well as the foe of liberty.
It had been so, in fact, in the Prussia of Frederick.
And democracy might be far more the foe than the
protector. It was obviously so in the France of the
Reign of Terror. Hamilton, a hard-headed man,
given to figures rather than to theories, saw all this;
Jefferson, a doctrinaire, even in his best moments,
saw only half of it. That failure to see together was
at the bottom of their difference—and their difference
came very near wrecking the United States.
Burr’s bullet probably prevented a colossal disaster.
But it also opened the way for troubles in the years to
come. We are in the midst of them yet, and we are
by no means near the end of them.</p>

<p>The shadow of Jeffersonism, indeed, is still over
us. We are still bound idiotically by the battle-cries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
of a struggle that was over more than a century ago.
We have got the half of liberty, but the other half
is yet to be wrested from the implacable fates, and
there seems little likelihood that it will be wrested
soon. All the fears of Hamilton have come to realization—and
some of the fears of Jefferson to fill the
measure. Minorities among us have no rights that
the majority is bound to respect; they are dragooned
and oppressed in a way that would make an oriental
despot blush. Yet behind the majority, often defectively
concealed, there is always a sinister minority,
eager only for its own advantage and willing
to adopt any device, however outrageous, to get what
it wants. We have a puppet in the White House,
pulled by wires, but with dangerous weapons in its
hands. Law Enforcement becomes the new state religion.
A law is something that A wants and can
hornswoggle B, C, D, E and F into giving him—by
bribery, by lying, by bluff and bluster, by making
faces. G and H are therefore bound to yield it respect—nay,
to worship it. It is something sacred.
To question it is to sin against the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>I wonder what Jefferson would think if he could
come out of his tomb and examine the Republic that
he helped to fashion. He was a man of towering enthusiasms,
but he was also sharply intelligent: he
knew an accomplished fact when he saw one. My
guess is that, at the first Jefferson Day dinner following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
his emergence, he would make a startling and
scandalous speech.</p>

<i>The Woes of a 100% American</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>THE NEW BARBARIANS, by Wilbur C. Abbott. Boston:
<i>Little, Brown &amp; Company</i>. [The American Mercury, May, 1925.]</p>
</div>

<p>It would be easy to poke fun at this disorderly and
indignant tract; even, perhaps, to denounce the
learned author, in a lofty manner, as a mere jackass.
His argument, at more than one place, is so shaky
that it tempts ribaldry with a powerful lure, almost a
suction. His premisses are often gratuitous and absurd;
his conclusions are often fantastic. Worse, he
argues in circles, and it is frequently hard to make
out what he is advocating, and why. Worst of all,
the urbanity suitable to a learned gentleman resident
in Sparks street, Cambridge, Mass., sometimes yields
to a libido far more suitable to an auctioneer, a
Federal district attorney or a Methodist bishop, and
he rants dreadfully. But against all this there is
yet something to be said, and that something, I think,
is sufficient to stay the impulse to have at him
brutally, either with cackles or with invective. It is,
in brief, this: that what he inveighs against, given
his natural and laudable prejudices, is plentifully
sufficient to excuse all his indignation, and all his incoherence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
and even his occasional departures from
the strict letter of the record—that it is a merit in
any man, facing what he deems to be incubi and succubi,
to belabor them in a hearty and vociferous manner,
and without too pedantic a respect for the rules
of evidence. That merit has nothing to do, at bottom,
with his rightness or wrongness; it lies in his mere
sincerity. Dr. Abbott is obviously full of sincerity;
no fair reader can doubt it for an instant. But he
has something more: he has under him a respectable
body of facts, sound ones as well as shaky ones. The
deductions he draws from them are often extravagant,
and now and then he mingles them with assumptions
that seems to me to do violence to the most elemental
common sense. Nevertheless, his basic facts remain,
and if I were an Anglo-Saxon as he is I suspect that
they would fever me as they fever him.</p>

<p>What he complains of, in a few words, is the assault
that has been made of late upon the old American
tradition and the fundamental canons of American
idealism, <i>i. e.</i>, upon the body of ideas that Americans
cherish as peculiarly their own, and believe in with
a romantic devotion. What he complains of, especially,
is that this assault has been made, in the main,
by men who are not “Anglo-Saxons” (the professor
himself quotes the term: a touching concession to
ethnological exactness)—that it has been largely led
by men whose very Americanism, when they claim to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
be Americans at all, is open to question. When I
say open to question, I mean, of course, by “Anglo-Saxon”
Americans. Dr. Abbott seems to be firmly
convinced that these are the only ones entitled to the
name. They are the pure stock; their ancestors conquered
the continent unaided. They alone partake
of the true national spirit, and may be trusted to
guard the national hearth. All other Americans are
in the position of visitors, interlopers, relatives-in-law.
They may become in time, if they are good,
creditable assistant Americans, but they can no more
enter into the full national heritage, as free equals,
than they can lift themselves by their boot-straps.
The American tradition, it appears, must forever remain
a bit strange to them; they are the children, not
of heroes, but of serfs. Thus it is no wonder that
their political notions, when they make bold to state
them, are exotic and subversive. They can imagine
government only as a power above and beyond the
citizen. If they are not in favor of kaiserism, then
they are in favor of communism, which is simply
kaiserism imposed from below. Their politics is
essentially a slave politics. They stand opposed
eternally to that self-reliant and somewhat pugnacious
individualism which is the mark of the true “Anglo-Saxon.”
If they ever come into power the Constitution
will be destroyed and freedom will perish.</p>

<p>Dr. Abbott’s book, as I have said, is somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
difficult; perhaps I misrepresent him in a few details.
But in the main, I believe, I gather his doctrine correctly;
it is, indeed, a doctrine that has grown very
familiar. The Ku Klux has carried it into every
hamlet in the land, and bolstered it with the authority
of Holy Writ. I could, if I would, amuse myself
by exhibiting the holes in it. Is it a fact, then,
that the “Anglo-Saxons” conquered the continent unaided?
What of the Spaniards and French? What
of the Dutch and Germans? What of the Scotch-Irish?
Is it a fact that they invented the American
scheme of government? What of Rousseau? Is it
a fact that all assaults upon that scheme have been
made by assistant Americans? What of Jefferson,
Jackson, Robert E. Lee, Jeff Davis, Bryan? Is it a
fact that all the enemies of the Constitution came
from below the salt? What of the Eighteenth
Amendment: does it damage the Bill of Rights more
or less than the late Dr. La Follette’s vaporous
schemes? Such questions suggest themselves in great
variety. I could roll them off until you stood agape.
But I have no desire to press a professor of history
unduly; his authority, in the last analysis, cannot be
upset by facts. And in the present case, whatever his
errors in detail, it seems to me to be quite clear that
the fundamental facts are on his side. There <i>is</i> unquestionably
a difference between the “Anglo-Saxon”
American and the non-“Anglo-Saxon”—a difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
in their primary instincts, in their reactions to common
stimuli, in their ways of looking at the world.
And that difference, of late years, <i>has</i> come to the estate
of a conflict, with the “Anglo-Saxon” striving to
keep what he has—his point of view, his cultural
leadership, his political hegemony—and the non-“Anglo-Saxon”
trying to take it away from him. To
deny that conflict is to fall into an absurdity far worse
than any Dr. Abbott is guilty of. To admit it is to
admit his clear right, nay, his bounden duty, to do
battle for his side, passionately, desperately, and with
any weapon at hand.</p>

<p>This he does in his book, and up to the limit of his
forensic skill, which, I regret to have to add, is not
noticeably great. If, at times, he grows a bit muddled,
and even maudlin, then let us not hold the fact
against him, for a man performing a <i>pas seul</i> upon a
red-hot stove cannot be expected to achieve an impeccable
step. It seems to me that this red-hot stove,
at the moment, is under every conscious “Anglo-Saxon”
in our great Republic—that he must be an
insensate clod, indeed, if he does not feel the heat.
The cultural leadership of the country is passing out
of his hands, and he is beginning to lose even his
political hegemony. I sat in the Democratic National
Convention in 1924 as the Hon. Al Smith rolled
up his votes, and watched the Ku Kluxers on the floor.
They were transfixed with horror: if it was a comedy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
then pulling tonsils is also a comedy. Dr. Abbott
mentions Dreiser. The influence of Dreiser upon the
literature of to-morrow in this land—upon all the
youngsters who are now coming to maturity in the
universities, and turning away from their ordained
professors—will be a hundred times as potent as that
of any New Englander now alive. Who is Dreiser?
When the grandfathers of the Republic were hanging
witches at Salem his forbears were raising grapes on
the Rhine. Dr. Abbott professes history at Harvard.
During the past ten years but one professor at that
great university has materially colored the stream of
ideas in America. He has since escaped abroad—and
is a Spaniard. Every day a new Catholic church
goes up; every day another Methodist or Presbyterian
church is turned into a garage. But there is no need
to labor the point. The fact is too obvious that the
old easy dominance of the “Anglo-Saxon” is passing,
that he must be up and doing if he would fasten his
notions upon the generations to come. And the fact
is equally obvious that his success in that emprise, so
far, has been extremely indifferent—that, despite the
great advantages that he enjoys, of position, of authority,
of ancient right, he is making very heavy
weather of it, and not even holding his own. I am
frankly against him, and believe, as I have often
made known, that he is doomed—that his opponents
will turn out, in the long run, to be better men than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
he is. But I confess that I’d enjoy the combat more
if he showed less indignation and more skill.</p>

<p>Dr. Abbott himself reveals many characteristic
“Anglo-Saxon” weaknesses. His incoherence I have
mentioned. There is also a downright inconsistency,
often glaring. On one page he denounces all non-“Anglo-Saxons”
as opponents of democracy; on another
(for example, page 242) he denounces the
fundamental tenets of democracy himself. This inconsistency
is visible in nine “Anglo-Saxon” gladiators
out of ten. What ails them all is that they have
to defend democracy, and yet do not believe in it.
Has any good “Anglo-Saxon” ever believed in it?
I sometimes doubt it. Did Washington? Did John
Adams? Jefferson did, but wasn’t there a Celtic
strain in him—wasn’t he, after all, somewhat dubious,
a sort of assistant American? In any case, the surviving
Fathers were all apparently against him. In
our own time how many “Anglo-Saxons” of the
educated class actually believe in democracy? I
know of none, and have heard of none. The late
war revealed their true faith very brilliantly and even
humorously. It was a crusade for democracy, and
yet one of the shining partners was the late Czar of
Russia! The assault upon the Kaiser was led by
Roosevelt! The chief official enemy of absolutism
was Wilson! No wonder the whole thing collapsed
into absurdity. Dr. Abbott falls into a similar absurdity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
more than once. His book would be vastly
more effective if he took all the idle prattle about democracy
out of it, and grounded it upon the forthright
doctrine that the “Anglo-Saxons,” having got
here first, own the country, and have a clear right
to impose political disabilities upon later comers—in
other words, if he advocated the setting up of an
“Anglo-Saxon” aristocracy, with high privileges and
prerogatives, eternally beyond the reach of the mongrel
commonalty. This, in point of fact, is what he
advocates, however much he may cloud his advocacy
in democratic terms. I call upon him with all
solemnity to throw off his false-face and come out
with the bald, harsh doctrine. There is more logic
in it than in his present nonsense; he could preach it
more powerfully and beautifully. More, he would
get help from unexpected quarters. I can speak, of
course, only for one spear. I might quibble and protest,
but I’d certainly be sorely tempted.</p>

<p>AN OLD-FASHIONED SENATOR, by Harris Dickson. New York:
<i>The Frederick A. Stokes Company</i>. [The Nation, October 14,
1925.]</p>
</div>

<p>Some time ago, essaying a literary survey of the
Republic, I animadverted sadly upon the dreadful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
barrenness of the great State of Mississippi. Speaking
as a magazine editor, I said that I had never
heard of a printable manuscript coming out of it.
Speaking as a frequenter of the Athenian grove, I
said that I had never heard of it hatching an idea.
Instantly there was an uproar from Iuka to Pascagoula.
The vernacular press had at me with appalling
yells; there were demands from the Ku Klux that
I come down to Jackson and say it again; Kiwanis
joined the Baptist Young People’s Society in denouncing
me as one debauched by Russian gold. Worse,
the Mississippi intelligentsia also had at me. Emerging
heroically from the crypts and spring-houses
where they were fugitive from Rotary, they bawled
me out as ignorant and infamous. Had I never
heard, they demanded, of Harris Dickson, the Mississippi
Balzac? Had I never heard of John Sharp
Williams, the Mississippi Gladstone?</p>

<p>I had, but remained unmoved. I now continue unmoved
after reading Balzac’s tome on Gladstone. It
is, in its small way, a tragic book. Here, obviously,
is the best that Mississippi can do, in theme and treatment—and
it is such puerile, blowsy stuff that reviewing
it realistically would be too cruel. Here the
premier literary artist of Mississippi devotes himself
<i>con amore</i> to the life and times of the premier Mississippi
statesman—and the result is a volume so
maudlin and nonsensical that it would disgrace a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
schoolboy. The book is simply mush—and out of
the mush there emerges only a third-rate politician,
professionally bucolic and as hollow as a jug.</p>

<p>Yet this Williams, during his long years in Congress,
passed in Washington as an intellectual.
Cloak-room and barroom gossip credited him with a
profound education and very subtle parts. Such
ideas, when they prevail in Washington, perhaps need
and deserve no investigation; the same astute correspondents
who propagated this one later coupled the
preposterous Coolidge with Pericles. But maybe
there was some logic in it, after all; Williams, at
some time in the past, had been to Heidelberg and
knew more or less German and French. That accomplishment,
in a Southern politician, was sufficient to
set the capital by the ears. So the Williams legend
grew, and toward the end it rose to the dignity of a
myth, like that of Dr. Taft’s eminence as a constitutional
lawyer. Even the learned hero’s daily
speeches on Teutonic mythology during the war did
not drag him out of Valhalla himself. The press-gallery
gaped and huzzahed.</p>

<p>But the Heidelberg chapter in Mr. Dickson’s book
leaves the myth rather sick. It starts off, indeed,
with a disconcerting couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">In Germany ’twas very clear</div>
<div class="verse">He’d leave the rapiers for beer.</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>And what follows is distressingly silent about cultural
accretions. Young Williams’ main business at
Heidelberg, it appears, was putting the abominable
Prussian <i>Junker</i> in their place. They naturally assumed
that their American fellow-student could be
thrown about with impunity. Encountering him on
the sidewalk, they tried, in the manner made historic
by the Creel Press Bureau, to shove him off. Presently
one of these fiends in human form came melodramatically
to grief. Williams challenged him,
and “according to Prussian ethics,” named the weapons—pistols.
A shock, indeed! The monster expected
sabers, at which he was diabolically expert,
but Williams didn’t intend “to go home with his face
all slashed, and have folks jeer at him for getting his
jaw cut on a beer glass.” Facing cold lead, the Prussian
was so scared that he fired prematurely. Worse,
he so lost his wits that he addressed his antagonist as
Freiherr Williams. That antagonist fired into a
snowbank. Some time later, having thus got all that
was of worth out of Heidelberg, he came sailing
home, “full even then of his ultimate intention: he’d
go in for politics, he’d become a professional politician.”</p>

<p>A professional politician he remained for thirty
years, always in office, first in the House and then in
the Senate. His start was slow—he practiced law for
a time—, but once he was on the payroll he stayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
there until old age was upon him. For a number of
years he was Democratic leader in the House; twice
he got the party vote for the Speakership. In the
Senate he was technically in the ranks, but on great
occasions he stepped forward. His specialties, toward
the end, were the divine inspiration of Woodrow
Wilson, the incomparable valor of the American
soldier, the crimes of the Kaiser, the superiority of
the “Anglo-Saxon,” the godlike bellicosity of the
Confederate gentry, and the nature and functions of
a gentleman. On these themes he discoursed almost
every afternoon. The boys in the press-gallery liked
him, and he got plenty of space. Always his rodomontades
brought forth dark hints about his esoteric
learning, and the news that, next after Henry Cabot
Lodge, he was the most cultivated man in the Senate.</p>

<p>Mr. Dickson prints extracts from some of his
speeches. Criticism, obviously, is an art not yet in
practice in Mississippi, even among the literati. I
used to read him in the <i>Congressional Record</i>; he was
really not so bad as Dickson makes him out. His
career, seen in retrospect, seems to have been mainly
a vacuum. Once or twice he showed a certain fine
dignity, strange in a Southern politician. He opposed
the Prohibition frenzy. He voted against the
bonus. But usually, despite his constant talk of independence,
he ran with the party pack. For years
a professional Jeffersonian, he brought his career to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
a climax by giving lyrical support to the Emperor
Woodrow, who heaved the Jeffersonian heritage into
the ash-can. During the La Follette uproar he was
one of the most vociferous of the witch-burners. He
passed out in silence, regretted for his rustic charm,
but not much missed.</p>

<p>I commend “An Old-Fashioned Senator” to all
persons who are interested in the struggle of the South
to throw off its cobwebs. Both as document and as
work of art the book makes it very plain why Mississippi’s
place in that struggle is in the last rank.</p>

<p>THE LIFE STORY OF ORISON SWETT MARDEN, by Margaret
Connolly. New York: <i>The Thomas Y. Crowell Company</i>.
[The American Mercury, February, 1926.]</p>
</div>

<p>If Dr. Martin had not written his first book, said
Frank A. Munsey one day, he would have been a
millionaire. By Munseyan standards, praise could
go no higher—and Munsey knew his man, for they
were fellow-waiters in a Summer hotel back in the
’70’s and kept up friendly exchange until Marden’s
death in 1924. Both sprang from the hard, inhospitable
soil of Northern New England, both knew
dire poverty in youth, both got somewhere a yearning
for literary exercises, and both cherished an immense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
respect for the dollar. But though fate brought them
together when they were young, they chose different
paths later on. Munsey, with “Afloat in a Great
City,” “The Boy Broker,” and other inspirational
master-works behind him, abandoned beautiful letters
for the stock market, and eventually gathered in so
much money that he could afford to butcher great
newspapers in sheer excess of animal spirits, as lesser
men butcher clay pigeons. Marden, going the other
way, abandoned the hotel business, for which he
seemed to have had genius, for the pen, and devoted
the last thirty years of his life to composition.</p>

<p>His bibliography runs to a hundred or more volumes—a
colossal, relentless, overwhelming deluge of
bilge. All his books have the same subject: getting
on in the world. That was, to him, the only conceivable
goal of human aspiration. Day in and day out,
for three decades, he preached his simple gospel to
all mankind, not only in his books, but also in countless
pamphlets, in lectures, and in the pages of his
magazine, <i>Success</i>. Its success was instantaneous
and durable. His first book, “Pushing to the Front,”
rapidly went through a dozen editions, and was presently
translated into a dozen foreign languages. It
remained, to the end, his best-seller, but it had many
formidable rivals. Altogether, his writings in book-form
must have reached a total of 20,000,000 copies,
including 3,000,000 in twenty-five tongues other than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
English. In Germany alone he sold more than
500,000 copies of thirty volumes. He remains to-day
the most popular of American authors in Europe,
and by immense odds. I have encountered translations
of his books on the news-stands of remote towns
in Spain, Poland and Czecho-Slovakia. In places
where even Mark Twain is unknown—nay, even Jack
London, Upton Sinclair and James Oliver Curwood—he
holds aloft the banner of American literature.</p>

<p>I lack the stomach for the job myself, but I think
a lot could be learned about the psychology of <i>Homo
boobiens</i> through an intensive study of Marden’s vast
shelf of books. The few I have read seem to be exactly
alike; no doubt all the rest resemble them very
closely. What they preach, in brief, is the high
value of hopefulness, hard work, high purpose and
unflagging resolution. The appeal is to the natural
discontent and vague aspiration of the common man.
The remedy offered is partly practical and partly
mystical—practical in its insistence upon the sound
utility of the lowly virtues, mystical in its constant
implication that matter will always yield to mind,
that high thinking has a cash value. An evil philosophy?
Surely not. A valid one? There it is not
so easy to answer. Marden is full of proofs that
what he preaches works—but only too often those
proofs show the incredible appositeness and impeccability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
of patent-medicine testimonials. How many
false hopes he must have raised in his day! One
imagines humble hearts leaping to the gaudy tales of
Judge Elbert Gary, Beethoven and Edison in the darkest
reaches of Montenegro, Norway and Tennessee.
Down went the dose, but was the patient actually
cured? Well, perhaps, he at least <i>felt</i> better—and
that was something. Marden was not to be pinned
down to clinical records; he was, in his way, a poet,
and even more a prophet. A religious exaltation was
in him; he knew how to roll his eyes. The first
article of his creed was that it was a sin to despair—that
realism was a black crime against the Holy
Ghost. He reduced the Beatitudes to one: Blessed
are they that believe in their stars, and are up and
doing.</p>

<p>His influence was immense, and perhaps mainly
for the good. He soothed his customers with his
optimistic taffy, and made them happier. It is, indeed,
small wonder that eminent figures in finance
and industry admired him greatly, and gave his
books to their slaves. He turned the discontents of
those slaves inward; instead of going on strike and
breaking windows they sat up nights trying to generate
inspiration and practicing hope and patience.
He was thus a useful citizen in a democratic state,
and comparable to the Rev. Dr. Billy Sunday. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
preached a Direct Action of a benign and laudable
sort, with Service running through it. His mark
shines brilliantly from the forehead of every
Y. M. C. A. secretary in the land, and from the foreheads,
too, of most of the editorial writers. Many
lesser platitudinarians followed him—for example,
Dr. Frank Crane and the Rev. Dr. Henry van Dyke—,
but he kept ahead of all of them. None other could
put the obvious into such mellow and caressing terms.
None other could so completely cast off all doubts
and misgivings. When he spit on his hands and let
himself out, the whole world began to sparkle like
a Christmas tree. He was Kiwanis incarnate, with
whispers of the Salvation Army. In early manhood
he had cast off the demoniacal theology of his native
hills, but one treasure of his Puritan heritage he
retained to the end: he knew precisely and certainly
what God wanted His children to be and do. God
wanted them to be happy, and He wanted them to
attain to happiness by working hard, saving money,
obeying the boss, and keeping on the lookout for
better jobs. Thus, after a hiatus of 137 years,
Marden took up the torch of Poor Richard. He
was, in his way, the American St. Paul. He was
the pa of Kiwanis. He carried the gospel of
American optimism to all the four quarters of the
world.</p>

<i>A Modern Masterpiece</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>THE POET ASSASSINATED, by Guillaume Apollinaire, translated
from the French by Matthew Josephson. New York: <i>The
Broom Publishing Company</i>. [The American Mercury, March,
1924.]</p>
</div>

<p>Whatever may be said against the young literary
lions of the Foetal School, whether by such hoary
iconoclasts as Ernest Boyd or by such virginal presbyters
as John S. Sumner, the saving fact remains
that the boys and girls have, beneath their false-faces,
a sense of humor, and are not shy about playing it
upon one another. Such passionate pioneers of the
movement as <i>Broom</i> and the <i>Little Review</i> printed,
in their day, capital parodies in every issue, many
of them, I believe, deliberate and malicious—parodies
of Ezra Pound by the Baroness Elsa von
Freytag-Loringhoven, and of the Baroness Elsa Freytag-Loringhoven
by E. E. Cummings, and of E. E.
Cummings by young Roosevelt J. Yahwitz, Harvard
’27. And the thing goes on to this day. Ah, that
the rev. seniors of the Hypoendocrinal School were
as gay and goatish! Ah, specifically, that Dr. Paul
Elmer More would occasionally do a salacious burlesque
of Dr. Brander Matthews, and that Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Matthews would exercise his forecastle wit upon the
Pennsylvania Silurian, Prof. Fred Lewis Pattee!</p>

<p>In the present work, beautifully printed by the
<i>Broom</i> Press, there is jocosity in the grand manner.
For a long while past, as time goes among such neo-logomaniacs,
the youths of the movement have been
whooping up one Guillaume Apollinaire. When
this Apollinaire died in 1918, so they lamented,
there passed out the greatest creative mind that France
had seen since the Middle Ages. He was to Jean
Cocteau, even, as Cocteau was to Eugène Sue. His
books were uncompromising and revolutionary; had
he lived he would have done to the banal prose of
the Babbitts of letters what Eric Satie has done to
the art of the fugue. Such news was not only printed
in the <i>Tendenz</i> magazines that come and go; it was
transmitted by word of mouth from end to end of
Greenwich Village. More, it percolated to graver
quarters. The estimable <i>Dial</i> let it be known that
Apollinaire was a profound influence on the literature
and perhaps still more on the art and spirit of this
modern period. Once, when Dr. Canby was off
lecturing in Lancaster, Pa., his name even got into
the <i>Literary Review</i>.</p>

<p>This electric rumor of him was helped to prosperity
by the fact that specific data about him were extremely
hard to come by. His books seemed to be
rare—some of them, indeed, unprocurable—, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
even when one of them was obtained and examined
it turned out to be largely unintelligible. He wrote,
it appeared, in an occult dialect, partly made up of
fantastic slang from the French army. He gave to
old words new and mysterious meanings. He kept
wholly outside the vocabulary at the back of “College
French.” Even returning exiles from La Rotonde
were baffled by some of his phrases; all that they
could venture was that they were unprecedented and
probably obscene. But the Village, as everyone
knows, does not spurn the cabalistic; on the contrary,
it embraces and venerates the cabalistic. Apollinaire
grew in fame as he became unscrutable. Displacing
Cocteau, Paul Morand, Harry Kemp, T. S. Eliot,
André Salmon, Paul Valéry, Maxwell Bodenheim,
Jean Giraudoux and all the other gods of that checkered
dynasty, he was lifted to the first place in the
Valhalla of the Advanced Thinkers. It was Apollinaire’s
year....</p>

<p>The work before us is the pricking of the bladder—a
jest highly effective, but somewhat barbarous.
M. Josephson simply translates Apollinaire’s masterpiece,
adds an <i>apparatus criticus</i> in the manner of
T. S. Eliot, and then retires discreetly to wait for
the yells. They will make a dreadful din, or I am
no literary pathologist! For what does “The Poet
Assassinated” turn out to be? It turns out to be
a dull pasquinade in the manner of a rather atheistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
sophomore, with a few dirty words thrown in to shock
the <i>booboisie</i>. From end to end there is not as much
wit in it as you will hear in a genealogical exchange
between two taxicab drivers. It is flat, flabby and
idiotic. It is as profound as an editorial in the
Washington <i>Star</i> and as revolutionary as Ayer’s Almanac.
It is the best joke pulled off on the Young
Forward-Lookers since Eliot floored them with the
notes to “The Waste Land.”</p>

<p>M. Josephson rather spoils its effect, I believe, by
rubbing it in—that is, by hinting that Apollinaire was
of romantic and mysterious origin—that his mother
was a Polish lady of noble name and his father a
high prelate of the Catholic Church—that he himself
was born at Monte Carlo and baptized in Santa Maria
Maggiore at Rome. This is too much. Apollinaire
was, like all Frenchmen of humor, a German Jew.
His father was a respectable waiter at Appenrodt’s,
by name Max Spritzwasser: hence the <i>nom de plume</i>.
His mother was a Mlle. Kunigunda Luise Schmidt,
of Holzkirchen, Oberbayern.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IX. THE FRINGES OF LOVELY
LETTERS</h2>
</div>

<h3>1<br>

<i>Authorship as a Trade</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is my observation as an editor that most
beginning authors are attracted to the trade
of letters, not because they have anything apposite
and exigent to say, but simply, because it
seems easy. Let us imagine an ambitious and somewhat
gassy young gal, turned out of the public high-school
down the street with good marks in English—that
is, in the sort of literary composition practiced
by schoolma’ms. Having read “Ulysses,”
“Jurgen” and “Babbitt,” she is disinclined to follow
her mother too precipitately into the jaws of holy
monogamy—or, at all events, she shrinks from marrying
such a clod as her father is, and as her brothers
and male classmates will be to-morrow. What to do?
The professions demand technical equipment. Commerce
is sordid. The secretary, even of a rich and
handsome man, must get up at 7.30 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> Most of
the fine arts are regarded, by her family, as immoral.
So she pays $3 down on a second-hand typewriter, lays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
in a stock of copy paper, and proceeds to enrich the
national literature.</p>

<p>It is such aspirants, I suppose, who keep the pot
boiling for the schools of short-story writing and
scenario writing that now swarm in the land. Certainly
these schools, in so far as I have any acquaintance
with them, offer nothing of value to the beginner
of genuine talent. They seem to be run, in the main,
by persons as completely devoid of critical sense
as so many Congressmen, street railway curve-greasers
or Methodist revivalists. Their text-books
are masses of unmitigated rubbish. But no doubt
that rubbish seems impressive enough to the customers
I have mentioned, for it is both very vague and very
cocksure—an almost irresistible combination. So
a hundred thousand second-hand Coronas rattle and
jingle in ten thousand remote and lonely towns, and
the mail of every magazine editor in America is as
heavy as the mail of a get-rich-quick stockbroker.</p>

<p>Unluckily, there is seldom anything in this mail
to bulge his eyes and make his heart go pitter-pat.
What he finds in it, day in and day out, is simply
the same dull, obvious, shoddy stuff—the same banal
and threadbare ideas set forth in the same flabby
and unbeautiful words. They all seem to write
alike, as, indeed, they all seem to think alike. They
react to stimuli with the machine-like uniformity and
precision of soldiers in a file. The spectacle of life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
is to all of them exactly the same spectacle. They
bring no more to it, of private, singular vision, than
so many photographic lenses. In brief, they are
unanimously commonplace, unanimously stupid.
Free education has cursed them with aspirations beyond
their congenital capacities, and they offer the
art of letters only the gifts suitable to the lowly crafts
of the jazz-baby and the schoolma’m. They come
from an intellectual level where conformity seems the
highest of goods, and so they lack the primary requisite
of the imaginative author: the capacity to see the
human comedy afresh, to discover new relations
between things, to discover new significances in man’s
eternal struggle with his fate. What they have to
say is simply what any moderately intelligent suburban
pastor or country editor would have to say, and
so it is not worth hearing.</p>

<p>This disparity between aspiration and equipment
runs through the whole of American life; material
prosperity and popular education have made it a sort
of national disease. Two-thirds of the professors in
our colleges are simply cans full of undigested knowledge,
mechanically acquired; they cannot utilize it;
they cannot think. We are cursed likewise with
hordes of lawyers who would be happier and more
useful driving trucks, and hordes of doctors who
would be strained even as druggists. So in the realm
of beautiful letters. Poetry has become a recreation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
among us for the intellectually unemployed and
unemployable: persons who, a few generations ago,
would have taken it out on china-painting. The writing
of novels is undertaken by thousands who lack
the skill to describe a dog-fight. The result is a
colossal waste of paper, ink and postage—worse, of
binding cloth and gold foil. For a great deal of
this drivel, by one dodge or another, gets into print.
Many of the correspondence-school students, after
hard diligence, learn how to write for the cheap magazines;
not a few of them eventually appear between
covers, and are solemnly reviewed.</p>

<p>Does such stuff sell? Apparently it does, else
the publishers would not print so much, of it. Its
effect upon those who read it must be even worse
than that of the newspapers and popular magazines.
They come to it with confident expectations. It is
pretentiously bound; <i>ergo</i>, there must be something
in it. That something is simply platitude. What
has been said a thousand times is said all over again.
This time it must be true! Thus the standardization
of the American mind goes on, and against ideas
that are genuinely novel there are higher and higher
battlements erected. Meanwhile, on the lower levels,
where the latest recruits to letters sweat and hope, this
rubbish is laboriously imitated. Turn to any of the
cheap fiction magazines, and you will find out how
bad it can be at its worst. No, not quite at its worst,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
for the contributors to the cheap fiction magazines
have at least broken into print—they have as they say,
made the grade. Below them are thousands of aspirants
of even slenderer talents—customers of the
correspondence schools, patrons of lectures by itinerant
literary pedagogues, patient manufacturers of the
dreadful stuff that clogs every magazine editor’s
mail. Here is the ultimate reservoir of the national
literature—and here, unless I err, is only bilge.</p>

<p>The remedy? I know of none. Moreover, I do
not believe in remedies. So long as the prevailing
pedagogues are not found out, and the absurd effort
to cram every moron with book-learning goes on in
the Republic, that long there will be too much reading,
and too much writing. But let us get out of the
fact whatever consolation is in it: too much writing,
at worst, is at least a bearable evil. Certainly it is
vastly less dangerous than too much religion, and less
a nuisance than too much politics. The floggers of
Coronas, if they were halted by law, might take to
the uplift—as, indeed, many corn-fed pedagogues
are already doing, driven out of their jobs by the
murrain of Fundamentalism. If I yell against them
it is because, on days when the rain keeps me indoors,
I am a critic. Perhaps other folks suffer less.
Nevertheless, I often wonder what the genuinely competent
novelists of the nation think of it—how the
invasion of their craft by so many bunglers and numskulls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
appears to them, and affects them. Surely it
must tend to narrow the audience they appeal to, and
so do them damage. Who was it who said that, in
order that there may be great poets, there must be
great audiences too? I believe it was old Walt. He
knew. Facing an audience deluged with molasses by
Whittier, Felicia Hemans and Fanny Fern, he found
the assumptions all against him. He was different,
and hence suspicious: it took him two generations
to make his way. The competent novelist, setting up
shop in America to-day, is confronted by the same
flood. If he is pertinacious, he may win in the end,
but certainly it takes endurance. Hergesheimer, in
his first book, unquestionably had something to say.
Its point of view was new; there was a fine plausibility
in it; it was worth attending to. But Hergesheimer
drove along for eight or ten years, almost in a vacuum.
I could add others: Anderson, Cabell, even Dreiser.
Cabell became known to the women’s clubs with his
twelfth book. Meanwhile, a dozen cheesemongers
had been adored, and a thousand had made good
livings with their sets of rubber-stamps.</p>

<i>Authors as Persons</i></h3>

<p>My trade forces me into constant association with
persons of literary skill and aspiration, good and bad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
male and female, foreign and domestic. I can only
report, after a quarter of a century of commerce with
them, that I find them, with a few brilliant exceptions,
very dull, and that I greatly prefer the society
of Babbitts. Is this heresy? If so, I can only offer
my sincere regrets. The words are wrung from me,
not by any desire to be unpleasant, but simply by a
lifelong and incurable affection for what, for want
of a better name, is called the truth. Nine-tenths
of the literary gents that I know, indeed, are hotter
for the dollar than any Babbitt ever heard of. Their
talk is not about what they write, but about what they
get for it. Not infrequently they get a great deal.
I know a number who make more annually than honest
bank presidents, even than Christian bank presidents.
A few probably top the incomes of railroad
purchasing-agents and nose-and-throat specialists, and
come close to the incomes of realtors, lawyers and
bootleggers. They practice a very profitable trade.</p>

<p>And no wonder, for they pursue it in the most
assiduously literate country in Christendom. Our
people, perhaps, seldom read anything that is good,
but they at least read—day and night, weekdays and
Sundays. We have so many magazines of more than
500,000 circulation that a list of them would fill
this page. We have at least a dozen above 1,000,000.
These magazines have immense advertising revenues,
and are thus very prosperous. They can therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
pay high prices for manuscripts. The business of
supplying such manuscripts has made a whole herd
of authors rich. I do not object to their wealth; I
simply report its lamentable effects upon them, and
upon the aspirants who strive to imitate them. For
those effects go down to the lowest levels. The neophyte,
as I have said, seldom shows any yearning to
discharge ideas, to express himself, to tackle and
master a difficult enterprise; he shows only a desire
to get money in what seems to him to be an easy way.
Short cuts, quick sales, easy profits—it is all very
American. Do we gabble about efficiency? Then
the explanation is to be sought in the backwashes of
Freudism. Nowhere else on earth is genuine competence
so rare. The average American plumber
cannot plumb; the average American cook cannot
cook; the average American literary gent has nothing
to say, and says it with rubber-stamps.</p>

<p>But I was speaking of the literati as persons.
They suffer, I believe from two things. The first is
what I have just described: their general fraudulence.
The second springs out of the fact that their position,
in the Republic, is very insecure—that they have no
public dignity. It is no longer honorable <i>per se</i> to
be engaged in travails of the spirit, as it used to be
in the New England of the <i>Aufklärung</i>; it is honorable
only if it pays. I believe that the fact discourages
many aspirants who, if they went on, might come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
to something. They are blasted in their tender years,
and so literature loses them. Too sensitive to sit
below the salt, they join the hearty, red-blooded men
who feast above it, admired by the national gallery.
It is, indeed, not surprising that the majority of college
graduates, once headed as a matter of course for
the grove of Athene, now go into business—that Harvard
now turns out ten times as many bond salesmen
every year as metaphysicians and martyrs. Business,
in America, offers higher rewards than any other
human enterprise, not only in money but also in
dignity. Thus it tends to attract the best brains of the
country. Is Kiwanis idiotic? The answer is that
Kiwanis no more represents business than Greenwich
Village represents literature. On the higher levels
its bilge does not flow—and on those higher levels,
as I have hinted, there are shrewder fellows, and more
amusing, than ever you will find in the Authors’
Club. These fellows, by the strict canons of ethnology,
are Babbitts, but it seems to me that they are
responsible nevertheless for everything that makes
life in the United States tolerable. One finds, in
their company, excellent wines and liquors, and one
seldom hears any cant.</p>

<p>I don’t believe that this is a healthy state of affairs.
I believe that business should be left to commonplace
and insensitive minds, and that men of originality,
and hence of genuine charm, should be sucked automatically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
into enterprises of a greater complexity and
subtlety. It is done in more ancient countries; it has
been done from remote antiquity under civilizations
that have aged in the wood, and are free from fusel
oil. But it is not yet done in These States. Only an
overwhelming natural impulse—perhaps complicated
by insanity—can urge an American into the writing
of fugues or epics. The pull is toward the investment
securities business. That pull, yielded to,
leads to high rewards. The successful business man
among us—and only the sheer imbecile, in such
gaudy times as these, is not successful—enjoys the
public respect and adulation that elsewhere bathe
only bishops and generals of artillery. He is treated
with dignity in the newspapers, even when he appears
in combat with his wife’s lover. His opinion is
sought upon all public questions, including the
æsthetic. In the stews and wine-shops he receives
the attention that, in old Vienna, used to be given to
Beethoven. He enjoys an aristocratic immunity to
most forms of judicial process. He wears the <i>legion
d’honneur</i>, is an LL. D. of Yale, and is received cordially
at the White House.</p>

<p>The literary gent, however worthy, scales no such
heights under our <i>Kultur</i>. Only one President since
the birth of the Republic has ever welcomed men of
letters at the White House, and that one, the sainted
Roosevelt, judged them by their theological orthodoxy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
and the hair upon their chests. A few colored poets
were added to make the first pages; that was all.
The literati thus wander about somewhat disconsolately
among us, and tend to become morose and
dull. If they enjoy the princely fees of the train-boy
magazines, they are simply third-rate business men—successful,
perhaps, but without the Larger Vision.
If they happen to be genuine artists—and now and
then it <i>does</i> happen—they are as lonely as life
insurance solicitors at a convention of Seventh
Day Adventists. Such sorrows do not make for
<i>Gemütlichkeit</i>. There is much more of it in the pants
business.</p>

<i>Birth Pangs</i></h3>

<p>I have just said that the typical American author,
when he talks intelligibly at all, talks of money. I
have said also that his aim in writing is not to rid himself
of ideas that bulge and fever his skull, but to get
that money in an easy way. Both statements, though
true, need a certain qualification. Writing looks easier
to the neophyte than any other job open to him,
but once he settles down to its practice he finds that it
is full of unanticipated pains. So he tends, as he
grows older, to talk of those pains almost as much as
he talks of their rewards in cash. Here, indeed, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
the authors that I know agree, if they agree on nothing
else, and in their agreement they show the greatest
heat and eloquence. And the beautiful ladies of
the trade reënforce and ratify the plaint of the bucks.
Writing, they all say, is the most dreadful chore ever
inflicted upon human beings. It is not only exhausting
mentally; it is also extremely fatiguing physically.
The writer leaves his desk, his day’s work done, with
his mind empty and the muscles of his back and neck
full of a crippling stiffness. He has suffered horribly
that the babies may be fed and beauty may not die.</p>

<p>The worst of it is that he must always suffer alone.
If authors could work in large, well-ventilated factories,
like cigarmakers or garment-workers, with
plenty of their mates about and a flow of lively professional
gossip to entertain them, their labor would
be immensely lighter. But it is essential to their
craft that they perform its tedious and vexatious
operations <i>a cappella</i>, and so the horrors of loneliness
are added to its other unpleasantnesses. An
author at work is continuously and inescapably in the
presence of himself. There is nothing to divert and
soothe him. So every time a vagrant regret or sorrow
assails him, it has him instantly by the ear, and
every time a wandering ache runs down his leg it
shakes him like the bite of a tiger. I have yet to meet
an author who was not a hypochondriac. Saving
only physicians, who are always ill and in fear of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
death, the literati are perhaps the most lavish consumers
of pills and philtres in this world, and the
most willing customers of surgeons. I can scarcely
think of one, known to me personally, who is not constantly
dosing himself with medicines, or regularly
resorting to the knife. At the head of the craft stand
men who are even more celebrated as invalids than
they are as authors. I know of one who——</p>

<p>But perhaps I had better avoid invading what, after
all, may be private confidences, though they are certainly
not imparted in confidential tones. The point
is that an author, penned in a room during all his
working hours with no company save his own, is
bound to be more conscious than other men of the
petty malaises that assail all of us. They tackle
him, so to speak, in a vacuum; he can’t seek diversion
from them without at the same time suffering diversion
from his work. And what they leave of him
is tortured and demoralized by wayward and uncomfortable
thoughts. It must be obvious that other men,
even among the intelligentsia, are not beset so cruelly.
A judge on the bench, entertaining a ringing in the
ears, can do his work almost as well as if he heard
only the voluptuous rhetoric of the lawyers. A
clergyman, carrying on his degraded mummery, is
not appreciably crippled by a sour stomach: what he
says has been said before, and only scoundrels question
it. And a surgeon, plying his exhilarating art<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
and mystery, suffers no professional damage from
the wild thought that the attending nurse is more
sightly than his wife. But I defy anyone to write
a competent sonnet with a ringing in his ears, or to
compose sound criticism with a sour stomach, or to
do a plausible love scene with a head free of private
amorous fancies. These things are sheer impossibilities.
The poor literatus encounters them and
their like every time he enters his work-room and
spits on his hands. The moment the door bangs he
begins a depressing, losing struggle with his body
and his mind.</p>

<p>Why then, do rational men and women engage in
so barbarous and exhausting a vocation—for there are
relatively intelligent and enlightened authors, remember,
just as there are relatively honest politicians,
and even bishops. What keeps them from deserting
it for trades that are less onerous, and, in the eyes
of their fellow creatures, more respectable? The
first, and perhaps the foremost reason I have already
exposed at length: the thing pays. But there is another,
and it ought to be heard too. It lies, I believe,
in the fact that an author, like any other so-called
artist, is a man in whom the normal vanity of all
men is so vastly exaggerated that he finds it a sheer
impossibility to hold it in. His overpowering impulse
is to gyrate before his fellow men, flapping his
wings and emitting defiant yells. This being forbidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
by the <i>Polizei</i> of all civilized countries, he
takes it out by putting his yells on paper. Such is
the thing called self-expression.</p>

<p>In the confidences of the literati, of course, it is
always depicted as something much more mellow and
virtuous. Either they argue that they are moved by
a yearning to spread the enlightenment and save the
world, or they allege that what steams them and
makes them leap is a passion for beauty. Both
theories are quickly disposed of by an appeal to
the facts. The stuff written by nine authors out of
ten, it must be plain at a glance, has as little to do
with spreading the enlightenment as the state papers
of the late Dr. Warren Gamaliel Harding. And
there is no more beauty in it, and no more sign of
a feeling of beauty, than you will find in a hotel
dining-room or a college yell. The impulse to create
beauty, indeed, is rather rare in literary men, and
almost completely absent from the younger ones.
If it shows itself at all, it comes as a sort of afterthought.
Far ahead of it comes the yearning to
make money. And after the yearning to make money
comes the yearning to make a noise. The impulse to
create beauty lingers far behind; not infrequently
there is a void where it ought to be. Authors, as a
class, are extraordinarily insensitive to beauty, and
the fact reveals itself in their customary (and often
incredibly extensive) ignorance of the other arts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
I’d have a hard job naming six American novelists
who could be depended upon to recognize a fugue
without prompting, or six poets who could give a
rational account of the difference between a Gothic
cathedral and a Standard Oil filling-station. The
thing goes even further. Most novelists, in my experience,
know nothing of poetry, and very few poets
have any feeling for the beauties of prose. As for
the dramatists, three-fourths of them are unaware that
such things as prose and poetry exist at all. It pains
me to set down such inconvenient and blushful facts.
They will be seized upon, I daresay, by the evangelists
of Kiwanis, and employed to support the doctrine that
authors are public enemies, and ought to be deported
to Russia. I do not go so far. I simply say that
many who pursue the literary life are less romantic
and high-toned than they might be—that communion
with them is anything but the thrilling thing that
provincial club ladies fancy. If the fact ought to be
concealed, then blame my babbling upon scientific
passion. That passion, to-day, has me by the ear.</p>

<i>Want Ad</i></h3>

<p>The death of William Dean Howells in 1920
brought to an end a decorous and orderly era in
American letters, and issued in a sort of anarchy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
One may best describe the change, perhaps, by throwing
it into dramatic form. Suppose Joseph Conrad
and Anatole France were still alive and on their way
to the United States on a lecture tour, or to study
Prohibition or sex hygiene, or to pay their respects
to Henry Ford. Suppose they were to arrive in New
York at 2 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> to-day. Who would go down the bay
on a revenue-cutter to meet them—that is, who in
addition to the newspaper reporters and baggage-searchers—who
to represent American Literature?
I can’t think of a single fit candidate. So long as
Howells kept to his legs he was chosen almost automatically
for all such jobs, for he was the dean of
the national letters, and acknowledged to be such by
everyone. Moreover, he had experience at the work
and a natural gift for it. He looked well in funeral
garments. He had a noble and ancient head. He
made a neat and caressing speech. He understood
etiquette. And before he came to his growth, stretching
back into the past, there was a long line precisely
like him—Mark Twain, General Lew Wallace, James
Russell Lowell, Edmund Clarence Stedman, Richard
Watson Gilder, Bryant, Emerson, Irving, Cooper, and
so on back to the dark abysm of time.</p>

<p>Such men performed a useful and highly onerous
function. They represented letters in all public and
official ways. When there was a grand celebration
at one of the older universities they were present in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
their robes, freely visible to the lowliest sophomore.
When there was a great banquet, they sat between
generals in the Army and members of the firm of
J. P. Morgan &amp; Company. When there was a solemn
petition or protest to sign—against fiat money, the
massacres in Armenia, municipal corruption, or the
lack of international copyright—they signed in fine
round hands, not for themselves alone, but for the
whole fraternity of American literati. Most important
of all, when a literary whale from foreign parts
was sighted off Fire Island, they jumped into their
frock coats, clapped on their plug-hats and made the
damp, windy trip through the Narrows on the revenue-cutter,
to give the visitor welcome in the name of the
eminent living and the illustrious dead. It was by
such men that Dickens was greeted, and Thackeray,
and Herbert Spencer, and Max O’Rell, and Blasco
Ibáñez, and Matthew Arnold, and James M. Barrie,
and Kipling, and (until they found his bootleg wife
under his bed) Maxim Gorky. I name names at random.
No worthy visitor was overlooked. Always
there was the stately committee on the revenue-cutter,
always there was the series of polite speeches, and
always there was the general feeling that the right
thing had been done in the right way—that American
literature had been represented in a tasteful and resounding
manner.</p>

<p>Who is to represent it to-day? I search the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
without finding a single suitable candidate, to say
nothing of a whole posse. Turn, for example, to
the mystic nobles of the American Academy of Arts
and Letters. I pick out five at random: William C.
Brownell, Augustus Thomas, Hamlin Garland, Owen
Wister and Henry van Dyke. What is wrong with
them? The plain but dreadful fact that no literary
foreigner has even heard of them—that their appearance
on the deck of his incoming barge would puzzle
and alarm him, and probably cause him to call for the
police. These men do not lack the homely virtues.
They all spell correctly, write neatly, and print nothing
that is not constructive. In the five of them there
is not enough sin to raise a Congressman’s temperature
one-hundredth of a degree. But they are completely
devoid of what is absolutely essential to the
official life: they have, so to speak, no stage presence.
There is nothing rotund and gaudy about them. No
public and unanimous reverence bathes them. What
they write or say never causes any talk. To be welcomed
by them, jointly or severally, would appear to
Thomas Hardy or Gabriel D’Annunzio as equal to being
welcomed by representatives of the St. Joe, Mo.,
Rotary Club. Nor do I find any better stock among
their heirs and apprentices in the National Institute.
Put Henry Sydnor Harrison, say, against Howells: it
is a wart succeeding Ossa. Match Clayton Hamilton
with Edmund Clarence Stedman: Broadway against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
Wall Street. Shove Robert W. Chambers or Herman
Hagedorn into the coat of Lowell: he would rattle
in one of its pockets.</p>

<p>Worse, there are no better candidates outside the
academic cloister. I daresay that most literate foreigners,
asked to name the principal American novelist
in practice to-day, would nominate Theodore
Dreiser. He would get probably seventy-five per
cent of the votes, with the rest scattered among Upton
Sinclair, Sinclair Lewis, Cabell, Hergesheimer and
Sherwood Anderson. But try to imagine any of
these gentlemen togged out in a long-tailed coat,
shivering on the deck of a revenue-cutter while
Gerhart Hauptman got a grip on himself aboard the
<i>Majestic</i>! Try to imagine Cabell presiding at a banquet
to Knut Hamsun, with Dr. A. Lawrence Lowell
to one side of him and Otto Kahn to the other!
Try to picture Sinclair handing James Joyce a wreath
to put upon the grave of James Whitcomb Riley!
The vision, indeed, is more dismal than ludicrous.
Howells, the last of his lordly line, is missed tremendously;
there is something grievously lacking in the
official hospitality of the country. The lack showed
itself the instant he was called away. A few
weeks later Columbia University gave a soirée in
honor of the centenary of Lowell. The president of
Columbia, Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, is a realist.
Moreover, he is a member of the American Academy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
himself, elected as a wet to succeed Edgar Allan Poe.
He was thus privy to the deficiencies of his colleagues.
To conceal the flabbiness of the evening he shoved
them into back seats—and invited John D. Rockefeller,
Jr., Tex Rickard, General Pershing and the
board of governors of the New York Stock Exchange
to the platform!</p>

<p>I believe that, of living masters of letters, H. G.
Wells was the first to feel the new chill. When he
last visited the Republic he was made welcome by
a committee of ship-news reporters. It was as if
one of the justices of the King’s Bench, landing in
America, had been received by a committee of police-court
lawyers from Gary, Ind. Later on American
literature bestirred itself and gave Wells a banquet
in New York. I was present at this feast, and a singular
one it was. Not a single author read in Iowa or
taught at Harvard was present. The principal literatus
at the board was the late Frank A. Munsey,
author of “Derringforth” and “The Boy Broker,” and
the principal address was made by Max Eastman,
formerly editor of the <i>Masses</i>!...</p>

<p>I come to a constructive suggestion. Let the
literati of America meet in their respective places of
social relaxation, each gang determining the credentials
of its own members, and elect delegates to a national
convention. Then let the national convention,
by open ballot, choose ten spokesmen and ten alternates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
to represent the national letters on all formal
occasions—not only when an eminent foreigner is
to be made welcome, but also when Columbia University
holds memorial services, when a President is
inaugurated, when Harvard meets Yale, when monuments
are unveiled—in brief at all times of solemn
public ceremonial. Let these representatives practice
deportment and elocution. Let them employ
good tailors and trustworthy bootleggers. I have,
alas, no candidates for the committee. As I have
said, there is a dreadful dearth of them. Does
Dr. Frank Crane wear whiskers? If so, I nominate
him.</p>

<i>Literature and the Schoolma’m</i></h3>

<p>With precious few exceptions, all the books on style
in English are by writers quite unable to write. The
subject, indeed, seems to exercise a special and dreadful
fascination over schoolma’ms, bucolic college professors,
and other such pseudo-literates. One never
hears of treatises on it by George Moore or James
Branch Cabell, but the pedagogues, male and female,
are at it all the time. In a thousand texts they set
forth their depressing ideas about it, and millions of
suffering high-school pupils have to study what they
say. Their central aim, of course, is to reduce the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
whole thing to a series of simple rules—the over-mastering
passion of their melancholy order, at all
times and everywhere. They aspire to teach it as
bridge whist, the American Legion flag-drill and
double-entry bookkeeping are taught. They fail as
ignominiously as that Athenian of legend who essayed
to train a regiment of grasshoppers in the goose-step.</p>

<p>For the essence of a sound style is that it cannot be
reduced to rules—that it is a living and breathing
thing, with something of the devilish in it—that it fits
its proprietor tightly and yet ever so loosely, as his
skin fits him. It is, in fact, quite as securely an integral
part of him as that skin is. It hardens as his
arteries harden. It has <i>Katzenjammer</i> on the days
succeeding his indiscretions. It is gaudy when he
is young and gathers decorum when he grows old.
On the day after he makes a mash on a new girl it
glows and glitters. If he has fed well, it is mellow.
If he has gastritis it is bitter. In brief, a style is
always the outward and visible symbol of a man, and
it cannot be anything else. To attempt to teach it is
as silly as to set up courses in making love. The
man who makes love out of a book is not making love
at all; he is simply imitating someone else making
love. God help him if, in love or literary composition,
his preceptor be a pedagogue!</p>

<p>The schoolma’m theory that the writing of English
may be taught is based upon a faulty inference from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
a sound observation. The sound observation is that
the great majority of American high-school pupils,
when they attempt to put their thoughts upon paper,
produce only a mass of confused and puerile nonsense—that
they express themselves so clumsily that
it is often quite impossible to understand them at all.
The faulty inference is to the effect that what ails
them is a defective technical equipment—that they
can be trained to write clearly as a dog may be trained
to walk on its hind legs. This is all wrong. What
ails them is not a defective technical equipment but a
defective natural equipment. They write badly simply
because they cannot think clearly. They cannot
think clearly because they lack the brains. Trying to
teach them is as hopeless as trying to teach a dog with
only one hind leg. Any human being who can speak
English understandably has all the materials necessary
to write English clearly, and even beautifully.
There is nothing mysterious about the written language;
it is precisely the same, in essence, as the
spoken language. If a man can think in English at
all, he can find words enough to express his ideas.
The fact is proved abundantly by the excellent writing
that often comes from so-called ignorant men. It is
proved anew by the even better writing that is done
on higher levels by persons of great simplicity, for
example, Abraham Lincoln. Such writing commonly
arouses little enthusiasm among pedagogues.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
Its transparency excites their professional disdain,
and they are offended by its use of homely words and
phrases. They prefer something more ornate and
complex—something, as they would probably put it,
demanding more thought. But the thought they
yearn for is the kind, alas, that they secrete themselves—the
muddled, highfalutin, vapid thought that
one finds in their own text-books.</p>

<p>I do not denounce them because they write so
badly; I merely record the fact in a sad, scientific
spirit. Even in such twilight regions of the intellect
the style remains the man. What is in the head infallibly
oozes out of the nub of the pen. If it is
sparkling Burgundy the writing is full of life and
charm. If it is mush the writing is mush too. The
late Dr. Harding, twenty-ninth President of the Federal
Union, was a highly self-conscious stylist. He
practiced prose composition assiduously, and was regarded
by the pedagogues of Marion, Ohio, and
vicinity as a very talented fellow. But when he sent
a message to Congress it was so muddled in style that
even the late Henry Cabot Lodge, a professional
literary man, could not understand it. Why?
Simply because Dr. Harding’s thoughts, on the high
and grave subjects he discussed, were so muddled that
he couldn’t understand them himself. But on matters
within his range of customary meditation he was
clear and even charming, as all of us are. I once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
heard him deliver a brief address upon the ideals of
the Elks. It was a topic close to his heart, and he
had thought about it at length and <i>con amore</i>. The
result was an excellent speech—clear, logical, forceful,
and with a touch of wild, romantic beauty. His
sentences hung together. He employed simple words,
and put them together with skill. But when, at a
public meeting in Washington, he essayed to deliver
an oration on the subject of the late Dante Alighieri,
he quickly became so obscure and absurd that even
the Diplomatic Corps began to snicker. The cause
was plain: he knew no more about Dante than a
Tennessee county judge knows about the Institutes of
Justinian. Trying to formulate ideas upon the topic,
he could get together only a few disjected fragments
and ghosts of ideas—here an ear, there a section of
tibia, beyond a puff of soul substance or other gas.
The resultant speech was thus enigmatical, cacophonous
and awful stuff. It sounded precisely like a
lecture by a college professor on style.</p>

<p>A pedagogue, confronted by Dr. Harding in class,
would have set him to the business of what is called
improving his vocabulary—that is, to the business of
making his writing even worse than it was. Dr.
Harding, in point of fact, had all the vocabulary that
he needed, and a great deal more. Any idea that
he could formulate clearly he could convey clearly.
Any idea that genuinely moved him he could invest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
with charm—which is to say, with what the pedagogues
call style. I believe that this capacity is possessed
by all literate persons above the age of fourteen.
It is not acquired by studying text-books; it is
acquired by learning how to think. Children even
younger often show it. I have a niece, now eleven
years old, who already has an excellent style. When
she writes to me about things that interest her—in
other words, about the things she is capable of thinking
about—she puts her thoughts into clear, dignified
and admirable English. Her vocabulary, so far, is
unspoiled by schoolma’ms. She doesn’t try to knock
me out by bombarding me with hard words, and
phrases filched from Addison. She is unaffected,
and hence her writing is charming. But if she essayed
to send me a communication on the subject,
say, of Balkan politics or government ownership, her
style would descend instantly to the level of that of
Dr. Harding’s state papers.</p>

<p>To sum up, style cannot go beyond the ideas which
lie at the heart of it. If they are clear, it too will be
clear. If they are held passionately, it will be eloquent.
Trying to teach it to persons who cannot
think, especially when the business is attempted by
persons who also cannot think, is a great waste of
time, and an immoral imposition upon the taxpayers
of the nation. It would be far more logical to devote
all the energy to teaching, not writing, but logic—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
probably just as useless. For I doubt that the
art of thinking can be taught at all—at any rate, by
school-teachers. It is not acquired, but congenital.
Some persons are born with it. Their ideas flow in
straight channels; they are capable of lucid reasoning;
when they say anything it is instantly understandable;
when they write anything it is clear and
persuasive. They constitute, I should say, about one-eighth
of one per cent. of the human race. The rest
of God’s children are just as incapable of logical
thought as they are incapable of jumping over the
moon. Trying to teach them to think is as vain an
enterprise as trying to teach a streptococcus the principles
of Americanism. The only thing to do with
them is to make Ph.D.’s of them, and set them to writing
handbooks on style.</p>

<i>The Critic and his Job</i></h3>

<p>The assumption that it may be scientific is the worst
curse that lies upon criticism. It is responsible for
all the dull, blowsy, “definitive” stuff that literary
pedagogues write, and it is responsible, too, for the
heavy posturing that so often goes on among critics
less learned. Both groups proceed upon the theory
that there are exact facts to be ascertained, and that it
is their business to ascertain and proclaim them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
That theory is nonsense. There is, in truth, no such
thing as an exact fact in the whole realm of the beautiful
arts. What is true therein to-day may be false
to-morrow, or vice versa, and only too often the shift
is brought about by something that, properly speaking,
is not an æsthetic consideration at all.</p>

<p>The case of Whitman comes to mind at once.
Orthodox criticism, in his own time, was almost unanimously
against him. At his first appearance,
true enough, a few critics were a bit dazzled by him,
notably Emerson, but they quickly got control of their
faculties and took to cover. Down to the time of
his death the prevailing doctrine was that he was a
third-rate poet and a dirty fellow. Any young professor
who, in the seventies or even in the early
eighties, had presumed to whoop for him in class
would have been cashiered at once, as both incompetent
and immoral. If there was anything definitively
established in those days, it was that old Walt
was below the salt. To-day he is taught to sophomores
everywhere, perhaps even in Tennessee, and
one of the most unctuously respectable of American
publishing houses brings out “Leaves of Grass” unexpurgated,
and everyone agrees that he is one of the
glories of the national letters. Has that change been
brought about by a purely critical process? Does it
represent a triumph of criticism over darkness? It
does not. It represents, rather, a triumph of external<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
forces over criticism. Whitman’s first partisans were
not interested in poetry; they were interested in sex.
They were presently reënforced by persons interested
in politics. They were finally converted into a
majority by a tatterdemalion horde of persons interested
mainly, and perhaps only, in making a noise.</p>

<p>Literary criticism, properly so-called, had little if
anything to do with this transformation. Scarcely a
critic of any recognized authority had a hand in it.
What started it off, after the first furtive, gingery
snuffling over “A Woman Waits for Me” and the
“Calamus” cycle, was the rise of political radicalism
in the early eighties, in reaction against the swinish
materialism that followed the Civil War. I am
tempted to say that Terence V. Powderly had more to
do with the rehabilitation of Whitman than any
American critic, or, indeed, than any American poet.
And if you object to Powderly, then I offer you Karl
Marx, with William Jennings Bryan—no less!—peeping
out of his coat-pocket. The radicals made
heavy weather of it at the start. To the average respectable
citizen they seemed to be mere criminals.
Like the Bolsheviki of a later era, they were represented
by their opponents as the enemies of all mankind.
What they needed, obviously, was some means
of stilling the popular fear of them—some way of
tapping the national sentimentality. There stood
Whitman, conveniently to hand. In his sonorous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
strophes to an imaginary and preposterous democracy
there was an eloquent statement of their own vague
and windy yearnings, and, what is more, a certificate
to their virtue as sound Americans. So they adopted
him with loud hosannas, and presently he was both
their poet and their philosopher. Long before any
professor at Harvard dared to mention him (save,
perhaps, with lascivious winks), he was being read to
tatters by thousands of lonely Socialists in the mining-towns.
As radicalism froze into Liberalism, and so
began to influence the intelligentsia, his vogue rose,
and by the end of the century even school-teachers
had begun to hear of him. There followed the free
verse poets, <i>i. e.</i>, a vast herd of emerging barbarians
with an itch to make an uproar in the world, and no
capacity for mastering the orthodox rules of prosody.
Thus Whitman came to Valhalla, pushed by political
propagandists and pulled by literary mountebanks.
The native Taines and Matthew Arnolds made a gallant
defense, but in vain. In the remoter denominational
colleges some of them still hold out. But
Whitman is now just as respectable at Yale as Martin
Tupper or Edmund Clarence Stedman.</p>

<p>The point is that his new respectability is just as insecure
as his old infamy—that he may be heaved out,
on some bright to-morrow, just as he was heaved in,
and by a similar combination of purely non-literary
forces. Already I hear rumors of a plan to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Dr. Coolidge King. If his conscience stays him, then
the throne may go to William Wrigley, Jr., or Judge
Elbert H. Gary, LL.D. Democracy, indeed, begins
to sicken among us. The doctors at its bedside dose
it out of a black bottle, and make sinister signals to
the coroner. If it dies, then Whitman will probably
die with it. Criticism, of course, will labor desperately
to save him, as it once labored to dispose of
him, but such struggles are nearly always futile.
The most they ever accomplish is to convert the author
defended into a sort of fossil, preserved in a showcase
to plague and puzzle schoolboys. The orthodox
literature books, used in all schools, are simply such
showcases. They represent the final effort of pedants
to capture zephyrs and chain torrents. They are
monuments to the delusion that criticism may be definitive—that
appeals to the emotions, which shift
and change with every wind, may be appraised and
sorted out by appeals to the mind, which is theoretically
unchangeable. Certainly every reflective
student of any of the fine arts should know that this
is not so. There is no such thing as a literary immortality.
We remember Homer, but we forget the
poets that the Greeks, too, forgot. You may be sure
that there were Shakespeares in Carthage, and more
of them at the court of Amenophis IV, but their very
names are lost. Our own Shakespeare, as year
chases year, may go the same way; in fact, his going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
the same way is quite as certain as anything we can
imagine. A thousand years hence, even five hundred
years hence, he may be, like Beowulf, only a name
in a literature book, to be remembered against examination
day and then forgotten.</p>

<p>Criticism is thus anything but scientific, for it cannot
reach judgments that are surely and permanently
valid. The most it can do, at its best, is to pronounce
verdicts that are valid here and now, in the light of
living knowledge and prejudice. As the background
shifts the verdict changes. The best critic is not that
fool who tries to resist the process—by setting up
artificial standards, by prattling of laws and principles
that do not exist, by going into the dead past
for criteria of the present—, but that more prudent
fellow who submits himself frankly to the flow of his
time, and rejoices in its aliveness. Charles Augustin
Sainte-Beuve was a good critic, for he saw everything
as a Frenchman of the Second Empire, and if his
judgments must be revised to-day it still remains
true that they were honest and intelligent when he
formulated them. Professor Balderdash is a bad
critic, for he judges what is done in the American
Empire of 1926 in the light of what was held to be
gospel in the pastoral Republic of a century ago.
For the rest, the critic survives, when he survives at
all, mainly as artist. His judgments, in the long run,
become archaic, and may be disregarded. But if,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
in stating them, he has incidentally produced a work
of art on his own account, then he is read long after
they are rejected, and it may be plausibly argued that
he has contributed something to the glory of letters.
No one takes much stock in Macaulay’s notions to-day.
He is, in fact, fair game for any college tutor
who has majored in what is called history. He fell
into many gross errors, and sometimes, it is probable,
he fell into them more or less deliberately. But his
criticism is still read—that is, as much as any criticism
is read. It holds all its old charm and address.
For Macaulay, when he sat himself down to be critical,
did not try fatuously to produce a scientific
treatise. What he tried to do was to produce a work
of art.</p>

<i>Painting and its Critics</i></h3>

<p>Having emerged lately from a diligent course of
reading in so-called art criticism, and especially in
that variety of it which is concerned with the painters
since Cézanne, I can only report that I find it windy
stuff, and sadly lacking in clarity and sense. The
new critics, indeed, seem to me to be quite as vague
and absurd as some of the new painters they celebrate.
The more they explain and expound the thing they
profess to admire, the more unintelligible it becomes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
Criticism, in their hands, turns into a sort of cabbalism.
One must prepare for it, as one prepares
for the literature of Service or of the New Thought,
by acquiring a wholly new vocabulary, and a new
system of logic.</p>

<p>I do not argue here that the new painting, in itself,
is always absurd. On the contrary, it must be manifest
to anyone with eyes that some of its inventions
are bold and interesting, and that now and then it
achieves a sort of beauty. What I argue is simply
that the criticism it has bred does not adequately
account for it—that no man of ordinary sense, seeking
to find out just what it is about, will get any light
from what is currently written about it. All he will
get will be a bath of metaphysics, heated with indignation.
Polemics take the place of exposition. One
comes away with a guilty feeling that one is somehow
grossly ignorant and bounderish, but unable to make
out why. The same phenomenon is occasionally witnessed
in other fields. I have mentioned the cases
of Service and the New Thought. There was, a generation
ago, the case of Ibsen and the symbolists.
These imbeciles read such extravagant meanings into
the old man’s plays that he was moved, finally, to
violent protests. He was not trying to compose
cryptograms, he said; he was simply trying to write
stage plays. In much the same way Cézanne protested
against the balderdash of his earliest disciples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
and interpreters. He was no messiah, he said; he
was only a painter who tried to reduce what he saw
in the world to canvas. The Ibsen symbolists eventually
subsided into Freudism and other such rubbish,
but the Cézannists continue to spoil paper with their
highfalutin and occult tosh. I have read nearly all
of them, and I denounce all that I have read as
quacks.</p>

<p>This tendency to degenerate into a mere mouthing
of meaningless words seems to be peculiar to so-called
art criticism. There has never been, so far as I
know, a critic of painting who wrote about it simply
and clearly, as Sainte-Beuve, say, wrote about books,
or Schumann and Berlioz about music. Even the
most orthodox of the brethren, when he finds himself
before a canvas that genuinely moves him, takes refuge
in esoteric winks and grimaces and mysterious
gurgles and belches. He can never put his feelings
into plain English. Always, before he is done, he
is sweating metaphysics, which is to say, nonsense.
Painters themselves, when they discuss their art, commonly
go the same route. Every time a new revolutionist
gives a show he issues a manifesto explaining
his aims and achievements, and in every such manifesto
there is the same blowsy rodomontadizing that
one finds in the texts of the critics. The thing, it
appears, is very profound. Something new has been
discovered. Rembrandt, poor old boy, lived and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
died in ignorance of it. Turner, had he heard of
it, would have yelled for the police. Even Gaugin
barely glimpsed it. One can’t make out what this
new arcanum is, but one takes it on faith and goes
to the show. What one finds there is a series of canvases
that appear to have been painted with asphalt
and mayonnaise, and by a man afflicted with binocular
diplopic strabismus. Is this sound drawing?
Is this a new vision of color? Then so is your grandmother
left-fielder of the Giants. The exceptions are
very few. I have read, I suppose, at least two hundred
such manifestos during the past twenty years;
at one time I even started out to collect them, as odd
literary delicatessen. I can’t recall a single one that
embodied a plain statement of an intelligible idea—that
is, intelligible to a man of ordinary information
and sanity. It always took a special talent to comprehend
them, as it took a special talent to paint the
fantastic pictures they discussed.</p>

<p>Two reasons, I believe, combine to make the pronunciamentos
of painters so bombastic and flatulent.
One lies in the plain fact that painting is a relatively
simple and transparent art, and that nothing
much of consequence is thus to be said about it.
All that is remarkable in even the most profound
painting may be grasped by an educated spectator
in a few minutes. If he lingers longer he is simply
seeing again what he has seen before. His essential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
experience, in other words, is short-lived. It is not
like getting shaved, coming down with the cholera
morbus, or going to the wars; it is like jumping
out of the way of a taxicab or getting kissed. Consider,
now, the position of a critic condemned to
stretch this experience into material for a column
article or for a whole chapter in a book. Obviously,
he soon finds it insufficient for this purpose. What,
then, is he to do? Tell the truth, and then shut
up? This, alas, is not the way of critics. When
their objective facts run out they always turn to subjective
facts, of which the supply is unlimited. Thus
the art critic begins to roll his eyes inward. He
begins to poetize and philosophize his experience.
He indulges himself in dark hints and innuendos.
Putting words together aimlessly, he presently hits
upon a combination that tickles him. He has invented
a new cliché. He is a made man. The
painter, expounding his work, falls into the same
bog. The plain fact, nine times out of ten, is that
he painted his picture without any rational plan whatever.
Like any other artist, he simply experimented
with his materials, trying this combination and then
that. Finally he struck something that pleased him.
Now he faces the dreadful job of telling why. He
simply doesn’t know. So he conceals his ignorance
behind recondite and enigmatical phrases. He soars,
insinuates, sputters, coughs behind his hand. If he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
is lucky, he, too, invents a cliché. Three clichés in
a row, and he is a temporary immortal.</p>

<p>Behind what is written about painting there is always,
of course, the immense amount of drivel that
is talked about it. No other art is so copiously discussed
by its practitioners, or encrusted with so much
hollow theorizing. The reason therefor—the second
of the two I mentioned above—lies in the obvious
fact that painters can talk while they work, and are
debarred from working at least half of their waking
hours. A poet, when his hormones begin to ferment,
not infrequently labors all night; when there is a
fog, a thunder-storm or a torch-light parade he is
specially inspired. So with a musical composer.
But a painter can work only while the light is good,
and in the north temperate zone that is not often. So
he has much time on his hands, and inasmuch as he
seldom has money enough to venture into general
society and is usually too ignorant to enjoy reading,
he puts in that time talking. Nowhere else on this
earth is there so much gabbling as you will find in
painters’ studios, save it be in the pubs and more or
less public bed-rooms that they frequent. It begins
as soon as the sun goes down, and it keeps on all night.
And it is always about painting, painting, painting.
No other class of artists is so self-centered. Once
a youth gets a brush into his hand and turpentine in
his hair, he appears to join a race apart, and is interested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
no longer in the general concerns of the
world. Even the other arts do not commonly engage
any of his attention. If he ventures into music,
it is into the banal music of college boys and colored
stevedores. If he reads it is only the colicky nonsense
that I have been describing. Even his amours
are but incidents of his trade. Now put this immense
leisure and this great professional keenness against
the plain fact that the problems of painting, in the
main, are very simple—that very little that is new
is to be said about any of them. The result is a vast
dilution of ideas, a stormy battle of mere words, an
infinite logomachy. And on its higher levels, embellished
with all the arts of the auctioneer, it is art
criticism.</p>

<h3>8<br>

<i>Greenwich Village</i></h3>

<p>The whole saga of Greenwich Village is in Alfred
Kreymborg’s autobiography, which he calls, very
appropriately, “Troubadour.” The story begins with
an earnest and insolvent young man in a garret,
fighting cockroaches and writing free verse. It ends
with a respectable gentleman of passing forty, legally
married to one very charming wife, and in receipt of
a comfortable income in royalties from the 6000
Little Theatres which now freckle and adorn our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
eminent Republic, distracting the males of the
Younger Married Set from the Red Peril and Service,
and their wives from millinery and birth control.</p>

<p>Of all the motley revolutionaries who flourished in
the Village in its heyday, say fifteen years ago,
Kreymborg was surely one of the most engaging, as
he was one of the most honest. Most of the others,
for all their heroic renunciation of commercialism,
were quite as hot for the <i>mazuma</i> as other literary
artists. With one breath they pledged themselves
to poverty—though not, surely, to chastity or obedience!—and
denounced such well-heeled poets as
Kipling and Shakespeare as base harlots of the marts.
With the next they bargained with such editors as
ventured to buy their wares like Potash tackling One-Eye
Feigenbaum. From this lamentable trafficking
Kreymborg held aloof, a genuine Parnassian. He
composed his bad poetry and his worse novels on a
diet of <i>Schnecken</i> and synthetic coffee, and paid for
that meager fare by teaching Babbitts the elements
of chess.</p>

<p>Gradually the tumult died, and Greenwich Village
fell into decay. The poets moved out, and Philistines
moved in; it was all over. But Kreymborg kept
the faith—at all events, longer than most. He continued
to write poems like a series of college yells,
plays unearthly and impossible, novels that brought
the Comstocks sliding down their poles like firemen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
But gradually he, too, began to show change. His
hair grew thin on top; his blood grew sluggish.
Presently some of his plays were produced; he had
at last squeezed through the proscenium arch. Then
he began to accept calls to read his dithyrambs before
provincial Poetry Societies. Then he became an
editor and an anthologist—ten paces behind his
ancient enemy, Louis Untermeyer. Then he went
through two divorces, one of them legal, and married
an estimable lady of Brooklyn. Now he is past forty,
has an agent, and pays income-tax. <i>Schön ist die
Jugendzeit; sie kommt nicht mehr!</i> As I have hinted,
there was always something charming about Kreymborg,
even in the days of his most raucous verse. He
threw up a good job with the Aeolian Company,
demonstrating mechanical-piano records, in order to
become a poet, and he stuck to his dream through
many a long year. The waspishness of the other
Villagers was not in him, and he was happily free of
their worst imbecilities. Between cantos of free
verse, I suspect, he often read Swinburne and even
Tennyson; in his mandolute he concealed Howells
and Mark Twain.</p>

<p>As one who poked many heavy jocosities at it while
it lasted, I hope I may now say with good grace that
I believe Greenwich Village did a good service to
all the fine arts in this great land, and left a valuable
legacy behind it. True enough, its own heroes were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
nearly all duds, and most of them have been forgotten,
but it at least broke ground, it at least stirred
up the animals. When it began to issue smoke and
flame, the youth of the country were still under the
hoof of the schoolma’m; when it blew up at last
they were in full revolt. Was it Greenwich Village
or Yale University that cleared the way for Cabell?
Was it the Village or the Philharmonic Society that
made a place for Stravinsky? Was it the Village
or the trustees of the Metropolitan Museum that first
whooped for Cézanne? That whooping, of course,
did not stop with Cézanne, or Stravinsky, or Cabell.
There were whoops almost as loud for Sascha Gilhooly,
who painted sunsets with a shaving brush, and
for Raoul Goetz, who wrote quartettes for automobile
horns and dentist’s drills, and for Bruce J. Katzenstein,
whose poetry was all figures and exclamation
points. But all that excess did no harm. The false
prophets changed from day to day. The real ones
remained.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">X. ESSAY IN PEDAGOGY</h2>
</div>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the purely technical side the American
novel has obviously made immense progress.
As ordinarily encountered, it is very
adeptly constructed, and not infrequently it is also
well written. The old-time amorphous novel, rambling
all over the place and ending with pious platitudes,
has pretty well gone out. The American
novelists of to-day, and especially the younger ones,
have given earnest study to form—perhaps, indeed,
too much. For in concentrating their powerful intellects
upon it they have lost sight of something that
is far more important. I allude, of course, to the
observation of character. Thus the average contemporary
American novel, though it is workmanlike
and well-mannered, fails to achieve its first business.
It does not evoke memorable images of human beings.
One enjoys reading it, perhaps, but one seldom remembers
it. And when it gets beyond the estate
of a mere technical exercise, it only too often descends
to the even worse estate of a treatise. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
attempts to prove something—usually the simple
fact that its author is a clever fellow, or a saucy
gal. But all a novel of genuine bulk and beam ever
proves is that the proper study of mankind is man—the
proper study and the most engrossing.</p>

<p>In brief, a first-rate novel is always a character
sketch. It may be more than that, but at bottom it is
always a character sketch, or, if the author is genuinely
of the imperial line, a whole series of them.
More, it is a character sketch of an individual not
far removed from the norm of the race. He may
have his flavor of oddity, but he is never fantastic;
he never violates the common rules of human action;
he never shows emotions that are impossible to the
rest of us. If Thackeray had made Becky Sharp
seven feet tall, and given her a bass voice, nine
husbands and the rank of lieutenant-general in the
British Army, she would have been forgotten long
ago, along with all the rest of “Vanity Fair.” And
if Robinson Crusoe had been an Edison instead of a
normal sailorman, he would have gone the same way.</p>

<p>The moral of all this is not lost upon the more
competent minority of novelists in practice among
us. It was not necessary to preach it to Miss Cather
when she set out to write “My Antonía,” nor to
Abraham Cahan when he tackled “The Rise of
David Levinsky,” nor to Sinclair Lewis when he was
at work on “Babbitt.” All such novelists see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
character first and the story afterward. What is the
story of “Babbitt”? Who remembers? Who, indeed,
remembers the story of “The Three Musketeers”?
But D’Artagnan and his friends live
brilliantly, and so, too, I believe, will George F.
Babbitt live brilliantly—at all events, until Kiwanis
ceases to trouble, and his type ceases to be real.
Most of the younger American novelists, alas, seem
to draw no profit from such examples. It is their
aim, apparently, to shock mankind with the vivacity
of their virtuosity and the heterodoxy of their ideas,
and so they fill their novels with gaudy writing and
banal propaganda, and convert their characters into
sticks. I read novel after novel without getting any
sense of contact with actual human beings. I am,
at times, immensely amused and sometimes I am instructed,
but I seldom carry away anything to remember.
When I do so, it is not an idea, but a person.
Like everyone else, I have a long memory for
persons. But ideas come and go.</p>

<p>All this becomes the more remarkable when one
considers the peculiar richness of the American
scene in sharply-outlined and racy characters. Our
national ideas, indeed, are mainly third-rate, and
some of them are almost idiotic, but taking one year
with another we probably produce more lively and
diverting people than all the rest of the world taken
together. More, these lively and diverting people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
tend to cluster into types. Mark Twain put half a
dozen of them into “Huckleberry Finn” and as many
more into “Roughing It,” a novel disguised as history.
Montague Glass collared a whole flock for his
Potash and Perlmutter stories, and Ring Lardner has
got another flock into his studies of the American
bounder. But the younger novelists, or at least the
overwhelming majority of them, stick to their sticks.
Thus even the most salient and arresting of American
types still lack historians, and seem doomed to perish
and be forgotten with the Bill of Rights. Babbitt
stood around for a dozen years, waiting for Lewis;
the rest of the novelists of the land gaped at him
without seeing him. How long will they gape at the
American politician? At the American university
president? At the American policeman? At the
American lawyer? At the American insurance man?
At the Prohibition fanatic? At the revival evangelist?
At the bootlegger? At the Y. M. C. A. secretary?
At the butter-and-egg man? At the journalist?</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>I have put the politician at the top of my list.
He probably embodies more typical American traits
than any other; he is, within his limits, the arch-Americano.
Yet how seldom he gets into a novel!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
And how seldom, having got there, is he real! I can
recall, indeed, but one American political novel of
any value whatever as a study of character, and that
is Harvey Fergusson’s story of Washington, “Capitol
Hill”—a series of casual sketches, but all of them
vivid and true. Fergusson really understands the
American politician. There is, in “Capitol Hill,”
no division of the <i>dramatis personæ</i> between Democrats
and Republicans, progressives and reactionaries,
materialists and idealists, patriots and traitors; the
only division is between men and women who have
something, and men and women who want it. In
that simple fact lies most of the book’s curious
reality. For the truth about Washington is that it is
not a town of politics, in the conventional and
romantic sense; it is, if anything, a town almost devoid
of politics. The people in the industrial cities
and out on the farms take political ideas seriously;
what they cherish in that department they refuse
passionately to surrender. But so far as I know
there are not a dozen professional politicians in
Washington, high or low, who would not throw overboard,
instantly and gladly, every political idea they
are assumed to be devoted to, including especially
every political idea that has helped them into public
office, if throwing it overboard would help them to
higher and gaudier and more lucrative office. I say
high or low, and I mean it literally. There has not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
been a President of the United States for half a
century who did not, at some time or other in his
career, perform a complete <i>volte face</i> in order to
further his career. There is scarcely a United
States Senator who does not flop at least three times
within the limits of a single session.</p>

<p>The novelists who write about Washington are
partly recruited from the ranks of the Washington
newspaper correspondents, perhaps the most naïve and
unreflective body of literate men in Christendom, and
for the rest from the ranks of those who read the dispatches
of such correspondents, and take them
seriously. The result is a grossly distorted and
absurd picture of life in the capital city. One
carries off the notion that the essential Washington
drama is based on a struggle between a powerful and
corrupt Senator and a sterling young uplifter. The
Senator is about to sell out the Republic to the Steel
Trust, J. P. Morgan or the Japs. The uplifter detects
him, exposes him, drives him from public life,
and inherits his job. The love interest is supplied
by a fair stenographer who steals the damning papers
from the Senator’s safe, or by an Ambassador’s wife
who goes to the White House at 3 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, and, at the
peril of her virtue, arouses the President and tells
him what is afoot. All this is poppycock. There
are no Senators in Washington powerful enough to
carry on any such operations single-handed, and very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
few of them are corrupt: it is too easy to bamboozle
them to go to the expense of buying them. The most
formidable bribe that the average Senator receives
from year’s end to year’s end is a bottle or two of
very dubious Scotch, and that is just as likely to
come from the agent of the South Central Watermelon
Growers’ Association as from John D. Rockefeller
or the Mikado of Japan. Nor are there any
sterling young uplifters in the town. The last was
chased out before the Mexican War. There are to-day
only gentlemen looking for something for themselves—publicity,
eminence, puissance, jobs—especially
jobs. Some take one line and some another.
Further than that the difference between them
is no greater than the difference between a Prohibition
agent and a bootlegger, or tweedledum and
tweedledee.</p>

<p>Ideas count for nothing in Washington, whether
they be political, economic or moral. The question
isn’t what a man thinks, but what he has to give away
that is worth having. Ten years ago a professional
Prohibitionist had no more standing in the town than
a professional astrologer, Assyriologist or wart-remover;
five years ago, having proved that his gang
could make or break Congressmen, he got all the
deference that belonged to the Chief Justice; now,
with the wet wolves chasing him, he is once more in
eclipse. If William Z. Foster were elected President<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
to-morrow, the most fanatical Coolidge men of to-day
would flock to the White House the day after, and try
to catch his eye. Coolidge, while Harding was living,
was an obscure and impotent fellow, viewed with
contempt by everyone. The instant he mounted the
throne he became a Master Mind. Fergusson got all
of this into “Capitol Hill,” which is not the story
of a combat between the True and the False in politics,
but the simple tale of a typical Washingtonian’s
struggle to the front—a tale that should be an inspiration
to every Rotarian in the land. He begins as a
petty job-holder in the Capitol itself, mailing congressional
speeches to constituents on the steppes;
he ends at the head of a glittering banquet table, with
a Senator to one side of him and a member of the
Cabinet to the other—a man who has somehow got
power into his hands, and can dispense jobs, and is
thus an indubitable somebody. Everybody in Washington
who has jobs to dispense is somebody.</p>

<p>This eternal struggle is sordid, but, as Fergusson
has shown, it is also extremely amusing. It brings
out, as the moralists say, the worst that is in human
nature, which is always the most charming. It reduces
all men to one common level of ignominy, and
so rids them of their customary false-faces. They
take on a new humanity. Ceasing to be Guardians
of the Constitution, Foes to the Interests, Apostles of
Economy, Prophets of World Peace, and such-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
banshees, they become ordinary men, like John Doe
and Richard Roe. One beholds them sweating, not
liquid idealism, but genuine sweat. They hope,
fear, aspire, suffer. They are preyed upon, not by
J. P. Morgan, but by designing cuties. They go
to the White House, not to argue for the World
Court, but to hog patronage. From end to end
of Fergusson’s chronicle there is absolutely no
mention of the tariff, or of the farmer and his
woes, or of the budget system, or of the Far Eastern
question. I marvel that more American novelists
have not gone to this lush and delightful material.
The supply is endless and lies wide open. Six
months in Washington is enough to load an ambitious
novelist for all eternity. (Think of what George
Moore has made of his one love-affair, back in
1877!) The Washington correspondents, of course,
look at it without seeing it, and so do all the Washington
novelists save Fergusson. But that is saying
nothing. A Washington correspondent is one with
a special talent for failing to see what is before his
eyes. I have beheld a whole herd of them sit through
a national convention without once laughing.</p>

<p>Fergusson, in “Capitol Hill,” keeps mainly to that
end of Pennsylvania avenue which gives his book
its name. I believe that the makings of a far better
novel of Washington life are to be found at the other
end, to wit, in and about the alabaster cage which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
houses the heir of Washington, Lincoln and Chester
A. Arthur. Why, indeed, has no one ever put
<i>kaiserliche Majestät</i> into fiction—save, of course, as
a disembodied spirit, vaguely radiating idealism?
The revelations in the Daugherty inquiry gave a hint
of unworked riches—but there is enough dramatic
and even melodramatic material without descending
to scandal. A President is a man like the rest of
us. He can laugh and he can groan. There are
days when his breakfast agrees with him, and days
when it doesn’t. His eyes have the common optical
properties: they can see a sweet one as far as they
can see a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
All the funnels of intrigue are aimed at
him. He is the common butt of every loud-speaker.
No other man in this sad vale has so many jobs to
give out, or one-half so many. Try to imagine a
day in his life, from dawn to midnight. Do it, and
you will have the best American novel ever heard of.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>But I am forgetting my other candidates—for
example, the American university president. I
mean, of course, the university president of the
new six-cylinder, air-cooled, four-wheel-brake model—half
the quack, half the visionary, and wholly the
go-getter—the brisk, business-like, confidential, button-holing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
regular fellow who harangues Rotary and
Kiwanis, extracts millions from usurers by alarming
them about Bolshevism, and so builds his colossal
pedagogical slaughter-house, with its tens of thousands
of students, its professors of cheese-making, investment
securities and cheer-leading, its galaxy of
football stars, and its general air of Barnum’s
circus. Why has this astounding mountebank not
got into a book? He fairly yells for loving
embalming <i>à la</i> Babbitt. He is not only stupendously
picaresque and amusing in himself—the final
heir, at once, of Abelard, Cagliostro, Increase Mather,
the Fox sisters, Pestalozzi, Dr. Munyon, Godey of
the <i>Ladies’ Book</i>, and Daniel Drew—; he is also
thoroughly and magnificently characteristic of the
great land we live in. No other country has ever
produced anything quite like him. No other country,
I suspect, would tolerate him. But here he lives
and flourishes, a superb and perfect American—and
yet our novelists all neglect him.</p>

<p>Worse and more incredible still, they neglect the
most American of all Americans, the very <i>Ur-Amerikaner</i>—to
wit, the malignant moralist, the
Christian turned cannibal, the snouting and preposterous
Puritan. Where is there the American novel
in which he is even half limned? There are, to be
sure, glimpses of him in “The Song of the Lark,” by
Willa Cather, and in “Babbitt,” and there is a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
elaborate but still incomplete sketch in E. W. Howe’s
“The Story of a Country Town.” But Howe,
unfortunately, had other fish to fry: he slapped
in his bucolic wowser brilliantly, and then passed
on to melodrama and the agonies of young
love. So, too, with Lewis and Miss Cather. Thus,
though the Puritan Father lies embalmed magnificently
in the pages of Hawthorne, his heir and assign
of the present day, the high-powered uplifter, the
prophet of harsh and unenforceable laws, the incurable
reformer and nuisance—this sweet fellow yet
awaits his anatomist.</p>

<p>What a novel is in him! Indeed, what a shelf of
novels! For he has as many forms as there are
varieties of human delusion. Sometimes he is a
tin-pot evangelist, sweating to transform Oklahoma
City or Altoona, Pa., into the New Jerusalem. Sometimes
he is a hireling of the Anti-Saloon League,
sworn to Law Enforcement. Sometimes he is a strict
Sabbatarian, bawling for the police whenever he
detects his neighbor washing bottles or varnishing the
Ford on Sunday morning. Again he is a vice-crusader,
chasing the scarlet lady with fierce Christian
shouts. Yet again he is a comstock, wearing out
his eyes in the quest for smut. He may even be
female—a lady Ph.D. in a linoleum hat, patrolling
the cow towns and the city slums, handing out edifying
literature, teaching poor Polish women how to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
have babies. Whatever his form, he is tremendously
grotesque and tremendously amusing—and always
he drips with national juices, always he is as thoroughly
American as a bootlegger or a college yell.
If he exists at all in other lands, it is only in
rudimentary and aberrant forms. Try to imagine a
French Wayne B. Wheeler, or a Spanish Billy Sunday,
or a German William Jennings Bryan. It is as impossible
as imagining a Coolidge in the Rome of
Julius.</p>

<p>Since the earliest days, as everyone knows, American
jurisprudence has been founded upon the axiom
that it is the first duty of every citizen to police his
neighbors, and especially those he envies, or otherwise
dislikes. There is no such thing, in this grand
and puissant nation, as privacy. The yokels out in
Iowa, neglecting their horned cattle, have a right, it
appears—nay, a sacred duty!—to peek into my home
in Baltimore, and tell me what I may and may not
drink with my meals. An out-at-elbow Methodist
preacher in Boston sets himself up to decide what I
may read. An obscure and unintelligent job-holder
in Washington, inspired by God, determines what I
may receive in the mails. I must not buy lottery
tickets because it offends the moral sentiment of
Kansas. I must keep Sunday as the Sabbath, which
is in conflict with Genesis, because it is ordered by
persons who believe that Genesis can’t be wrong.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
Such are the laws of the greatest free nation ever
seen on earth. We are all governed by them. But
a government of laws, of course, is a mere phantasm
of political theorists: the thing is always found, on
inspection, to be really a government of men. In
the United States, it seems to me, the tendency is for
such men to come increasingly from the class of
professional uplifters. It is not the bankers who
run the ostensible heads of the state, as the Liberals
believe, nor the so-called bosses, as the bosses themselves
believe, but the wowsers. And what is a wowser?
What does the word mean? It means precisely
what you think of inevitably when you hear it. A
wowser is a wowser. He bears a divine commission
to regulate and improve the rest of us. He knows
exactly what is best for us. He is what Howe calls a
Good Man. So long as you and I are sinful, he
can’t sleep. So long as we are happy, he is after us.</p>

<p>I throw off the guess that there are at least forty
novels in the wowser—that is, forty good ones. He
has, as I have said, as many forms as the demons who
ride him, and every one of them should make a competent
novelist, authentically called to the vocation,
leap in air with loud hosannas, and spit upon his
hands. His psychology remains mysterious. The
Freudians, I believe, have misunderstood him, and
the psychiatrists have avoided him. What are the
springs of his peculiar frenzy to harass and punish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
his fellow men? By what process of malign eugenics
is he hatched? And what is his typical life
history? Here is work for the novelist, which is to
say, for the professional anatomist of character. I
believe that Frank Norris, had he lived, would have
tackled it with enthusiasm, and made a great success
of its execution. Norris, like Dreiser after him, had
a romantic and even a mystical inclination, but at
bottom he was a satirist—and the American Puritan
was made for satirists as catnip was made for cats.
It is easy to laugh at him, but it is hard to hate him.
He is eternally in the position of a man trying to
empty the ocean with a tin-dipper. He will be
mauled, and the chance he offers thrown away, if
the novelist who attempts him in the end forgets the
tragedy under his comedy. I have known many
American wowsers in my time, some of them intimately.
They were all intensely unhappy men.
They suffered as vastly as Prometheus chained to his
rock, with the buzzards exploring his liver. A novelist
blind to that capital fact will never comprehend
the type. It needs irony—but above all it needs pity.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>So does another type that also awaits its Thackeray:
to wit, the American journalist. Most American
novelists, before they challenge Dostoevski, put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
in an apprenticeship on the public prints, and thus
have a chance to study and grasp the peculiarities of
the journalistic mind; nevertheless, the fact remains
that there is not a single genuine newspaper man, done
in the grand manner, in the whole range of American
fiction. As in the case of the wowser, there are some
excellent brief sketches, but there is no adequate portrait
of the journalist as a whole, from his beginnings
as a romantic young reporter to his finish as a Babbitt,
correct in every idea and as hollow as a jug.
Here, I believe, is genuine tragedy. Here is the matter
that enters into all fiction of the first class. Here
is human character in disintegration—the primary
theme of every sound novelist ever heard of, from
Fielding to Zola and from Turgeniev to Joseph Conrad.
I know of no American who starts from a
higher level of aspiration than the journalist. He
is, in his first phase, genuinely romantic. He plans
to be both an artist and a moralist—a master of lovely
words and a merchant of sound ideas. He ends,
commonly, as the most depressing jackass in his community—that
is, if his career goes on to what is
called success. He becomes the repository of all its
worst delusions and superstitions. He becomes the
darling of all its frauds and idiots, and the despair of
all its honest men. He belongs to a good club, and
the initiation fee was his soul.</p>

<p>Here I speak by the book, for I have been in active<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
practice as a journalist for more than a quarter of a
century, and have an immense acquaintance in the
craft. I could name a man who fits my specifications
exactly in every American city east of the Mississippi,
and refrain only on the advice of counsel.
I do not say that all journalists go that route. Far
from it! Many escape by failing; some even escape
by succeeding. But the majority succumb. They
begin with high hopes. They end with safe jobs.
In the career of any such man, it seems to me, there
are materials for fiction of the highest order. He is
interesting intrinsically, for his early ambition is at
least not ignoble—he is not born an earthworm. And
he is interesting as a figure in drama, for he falls
gradually, resisting all the while, to forces that are
beyond his strength. If he can’t make the grade, it
is not because he is unwilling or weak, but because
the grade itself is too steep. Here is tragedy—and
here is America. For the curse of this country, as of
all democracies, is precisely the fact that it treats its
best men as enemies. The aim of our society, if it
may be said to have an aim, is to iron them out.
The ideal American, in the public sense, is a respectable
vacuum.</p>

<p>I heave this typical American journalist to the
massed novelists of the Federal Union, and invite
them to lay on. There is a capital novel in him—a
capital character sketch and a capital picture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
the American scene. He is representative and yet he
is not commonplace. People will recognize him, and
yet they are not familiar with him. Let the fictioneers
have at him! But let them bear in mind that,
like the wowser, he is not to be done to the tune of
superior sneers. He is a wreck, but he has not succumbed
to the gales without resistance. Let him be
done ironically, as Lewis did Babbitt, but let him be
done also with pity. He is not a comedian, but a
tragedian. Above all, let him be done without any
mouthing of theories. His simple story is poignant
enough.</p>

<p>Is he too difficult? Then I offer a substitute: the
American policeman. Certainly it is high time for
him to get into a book. I dedicate him to the novelists
of the nation at once, and provide them simultaneously
with all the plot they will need. A moron with
an IQ of 53, despairing of ever getting a better job,
goes on the force and begins pounding a beat. A
chance favor to a saloonkeeper makes a sergeant of
him, and thereafter he slowly mounts the ladder. At
the end he is an inspector, and in charge of operations
against a fabulous crime wave, imagined by the
city editor of a tabloid newspaper. Isn’t that enough?
What a vivid and exhilarating picture of American
life could be got out of it! What humors are there,
and what genuine drama! Nor are the materials
esoteric. Every newspaper reporter’s head is stuffed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
with them. I myself could do such a work in ten
volumes folio. Nine young journalists out of ten, I
believe, aspire to the novel. Well, here is a chance
to write a novel as good as “Babbitt.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI. ON LIVING IN BALTIMORE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SOME time ago, writing in an eminent Baltimore
newspaper upon the Baltimore of my boyhood,
I permitted myself an eloquent passage upon
its charm, and let fall the doctrine that nearly all of
that charm had vanished. Mere rhetoric, I greatly
fear. The old charm, in truth, still survives in the
town, despite the frantic efforts of the boosters and
boomers who, in late years, have replaced all its ancient
cobblestones with asphalt, and bedizened it with
Great White Ways and suburban boulevards, and surrounded
it with stinking steel plants and oil refineries,
and increased its population from 400,000 to 800,000.
I am never more conscious of the fact than
when I return to it from New York. Behind me lies
the greatest city of the modern world, with more
money in it than all Europe and more clowns and
harlots than all Asia, and yet it has no more charm
than a circus lot or a second-rate hotel. It can’t show
a single genuinely distinguished street. It hasn’t a
single park that is more lovely than a cemetery lot.
It is without manner as it is without manners. Escaping
from it to so ancient and solid a town as Baltimore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
is like coming out of a football crowd into quiet
communion with a fair one who is also amiable, and
has the gift of consolation for hard-beset and despairing
men.</p>

<p>I have confessed to rhetoric, but I surely do not
indulge in it here. For twenty-five years I have resisted
a constant temptation to move to New York, and
I resist it more easily to-day than I did when it began.
I am, perhaps, the most arduous commuter
ever heard of, even in that Babylon of commuters.
My office is on Manhattan Island and has been there
since 1914; yet I live, vote and have my being in
Baltimore, and go back there the instant my job allows.
If my desk bangs at 3 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> I leap for the
3.25 train. Four long hours in the Pullman follow,
but the first is the worst. My back, at all events, is
toward New York! Behind lies a place fit only for
the gross business of getting money; ahead is a place
made for enjoying it.</p>

<p>What makes New York so dreadful, I believe, is
mainly the fact that the vast majority of its people
have been forced to rid themselves of one of the oldest
and most powerful of human instincts—the instinct
to make a permanent home. Crowded, shoved
about and exploited without mercy, they have lost the
feeling that any part of the earth belongs to them, and
so they simply camp out like tramps, waiting for the
constables to rush in and chase them away. I am not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
speaking here of the poor (God knows how they exist
in New York at all!); I am speaking of the well-to-do,
even of the rich. The very richest man, in New
York, is never quite sure that the house he lives in
now will be his next year—that he will be able to resist
the constant pressure of business expansion and
rising land values. I have known actual millionaires
to be chased out of their homes in this way, and
forced into apartments. In Baltimore too, the same
pressure exists, to be sure, but it is not oppressive, for
the householder can meet it by yielding to it half way.
It may force him into the suburbs, even into the adjacent
country, but he is still in direct contact with
the city, sharing in its life, and wherever he lands
he may make a stand. But on Manhattan Island he
is quickly brought up by the rivers, and once he has
crossed them he may as well move to Syracuse or
Trenton.</p>

<p>Nine times out of ten he tries to avoid crossing
them. That is, he moves into meaner quarters on the
island itself, and pays more for them. His house
gives way to a flat—one offering perhaps half the
room for his goods and chattels that his house offered.
Next year he is in a smaller flat, and three-fourths
of his goods and chattels have vanished. A
few years more, and he is in two or three rooms.
Finally, he lands in an hotel. At this point he ceases
to exist as the head of a house. His quarters are precisely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
like the quarters of 50,000 other men. The
front he presents to the world is simply an anonymous
door on a gloomy corridor. Inside, he lives like a
sardine in a can. Such a habitation, it must be plain,
cannot be called a home. A home is not a mere transient
shelter: its essence lies in its permanence, in its
capacity for accretion and solidification, in its quality
of representing, in all its details, the personalities
of the people who live in it. In the course of years
it becomes a sort of museum of these people; they
give it its indefinable air, separating it from all other
homes, as one human face is separated from all
others. It is at once a refuge from the world, a
treasure-house, a castle, and the shrine of a whole hierarchy
of peculiarly private and potent gods.</p>

<p>This concept of the home cannot survive the mode
of life that prevails in New York. I have seen it
go to pieces under my eyes in the houses of my own
friends. The intense crowding in the town, and the
restlessness and unhappiness that go with it, make it
almost impossible for anyone to accumulate the
materials of a home—the trivial, fortuitous and often
grotesque things that gather around a family, as
glories and debts gather around a state. The New
Yorker lacks the room to house them; he thus learns
to live without them. In the end he is a stranger in
the house he lives in. More and more, it tends to be
no more than Job No. 16432b from this or that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
decorator’s studio. I know one New Yorker, a man
of considerable means, who moves every three years.
Every time he moves his wife sells the entire contents
of the apartment she is leaving, and employs a
decorator to outfit the new one. To me, at all
events, such a mode of living would be unendurable.
The charm of getting home, as I see it, is the charm
of getting back to what is inextricably my own—to
things familiar and long loved, to things that belong
to me alone and none other. I have lived in one
house in Baltimore for nearly forty-five years. It
has changed in that time, as I have—but somehow it
still remains the same. No conceivable decorator’s
masterpiece could give me the same ease. It is as
much a part of me as my two hands. If I had to
leave it I’d be as certainly crippled as if I lost a leg.</p>

<p>I believe that this feeling for the hearth, for the
immemorial lares and penates, is infinitely stronger
in Baltimore than in New York—that it has better
survived there, indeed, than in any other large city
of America—and that its persistence accounts for
the superior charm of the town. There are, of
course, thousands of Baltimoreans in flats—but I
know of none to whom a flat seems more than a make-shift,
a substitute, a necessary and temporary evil.
They are all planning to get out, to find house-room in
one of the new suburbs, to resume living in a home.
What they see about them is too painfully not theirs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
The New Yorker has simply lost that discontent. He
is a vagabond. His notions of the agreeable become
those of a vaudeville actor. He takes on the
shallowness and unpleasantness of any other homeless
man. He is highly sophisticated, and inordinately
trashy. The fact no doubt explains the lack
of charm that one finds in his town; the fact that the
normal man of Baltimore is almost his exact antithesis
explains the charm that is there. Human relations,
in such a place, tend to assume a solid permanence.
A man’s circle of friends becomes a sort
of extension of his family circle. His contacts are
with men and women who are rooted as he is. They
are not moving all the time, and so they are not
changing their friends all the time. Thus abiding
relationships tend to be built up, and when fortune
brings unexpected changes, they survive those changes.
The men I know and esteem in Baltimore are, on the
whole, men I have known and esteemed a long while;
even those who have come into my ken relatively lately
seem likely to last. But of the men I knew best when
I first began going to New York, twenty-five years
ago, not one is a friend to-day. Of those I knew best
ten years ago, not six are friends. The rest have
got lost in the riot, and the friends of to-day, I sometimes
fear, will get lost in the same way.</p>

<p>In human relationships that are so casual there is
seldom any satisfaction. It is our fellows who make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
life endurable to us, and give it a purpose and a meaning;
if our contacts with them are light and frivolous
there is something lacking, and it is something of the
very first importance. What I contend is that in Baltimore,
under a slow-moving and cautious social organization,
touched by the Southern sun, such contacts
are more enduring than elsewhere, and that life
in consequence is more agreeable. Of the external
embellishments of life there is a plenty there—as
great a supply, indeed, to any rational taste, as in
New York itself. But there is also something much
better: a tradition of sound and comfortable living.
A Baltimorean is not merely John Doe, an isolated
individual of <i>Homo sapiens</i>, exactly like every other
John Doe. He is John Doe <i>of</i> a certain place—of
Baltimore, of a definite <i>house</i> in Baltimore. It is
not by accident that all the peoples of Europe, very
early in their history, distinguished their best men
by adding <i>of</i> this or that place to their names.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII. THE LAST NEW ENGLANDER</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE late Prof. Barrett Wendell, of Harvard,
whose letters have been done into a stately
volume by M. A. DeWolfe Howe, will probably
go down into history as the last flower of the
Puritan <i>Kultur</i>. Himself by no means a pure New
Englander, for his surname was obviously Dutch, he
yet had enough New England blood in him to feel
himself wholly of that forlorn region, and he was
accepted as a fit representative of it by all its tribal
headmen. He was steeped in its tradition, and venerated
its heroes. What came out of New England
seemed to him to be virtuous and lovely, or, as he
might have said, gentlemanly; what came out of the
rest of the country was simply barbarous.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Wendell was himself a walking proof
that all he admired was passing into the shadows, for,
try as he would, he could not, as a contemporary
man, squeeze himself into the old Puritan mold.
Over and over again he would make an effort to do so,
but always, as he struggled with the lid, a diabolical,
iconoclastic mood would overcome him, and he would
leap up and emit a ribald yell. Harvard, startled and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
uneasy, never knew what to make of him. His principles
were apparently impeccable; he was, in the current
phrase, a consistent booster for the lost Golden
Age, its glories and high deeds. And yet, whenever the
answering cheer came back, he would make a mocking
face and say something awful. The Cambridge
campus is still warmed by these mockings. What
saved him from downright infamy was the fact that,
whenever they were actually in contempt of the Puritan
mores and gnosiology, they were safely superficial—that
is, they never questioned fundamentals. Wendell
had a lot to say about the transient excesses and
imbecilities of democracy, visible in his time, but
he nevertheless believed in all the primary democratic
fallacies, and even defended them eloquently.
He was a tart critic of the whole educational process,
and went to the length, in his own department of
English, of denying it any value whatever; nevertheless,
he remained a romantic Harvard man to the
end of his days, and venerated <i>alma mater</i> with the
best of them. He must have seen clearly that there
was little that was sound and solid left in the New
England culture, that the rest of the country had little
need of it and would quickly surpass it; all the same,
he clung to the superstition that the preposterous
theologians of its early days constituted an intellectual
aristocracy, and even wrote a book eulogizing
the most absurd of them, Cotton Mather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>Wendell, in fact, was two men, separate and distinct,
and they were often at war. One of these men
was highly intelligent (though surely not very
learned); the other was a romantic under the spell
of a disintegrating tradition. The latter was the
more charming, but often a prey to mere lyrical
fancy. The picture of the American character that
Wendell presented to gaping throngs in his Sorbonne
lectures was a sort of fantastic chromo of the primeval
New England character, seen through nine thicknesses
of amber gelatine—in brief, a thing as bizarre
as the accounts of the Revolution that used to be in
school-books. Fundamentally, he once said somewhere
else, we believe in fair play. It would be hard
to imagine a more inaccurate saying. If any single
quality, indeed, has marked off the Americano from
all other civilized men since the start, it is his incapacity
to purge combat of passion, his strong disinclination
to allow any merit whatever to the other
fellow;—in brief, his bad sportsmanship. Our history
is a history of minorities put down with clubs.
Even the duel, during the few years it flourished in
America, took on a ferocity unheard of elsewhere.
Gentlemen, going out at daybreak, shot to kill.
Aaron Burr was a thorough American; Hamilton was
an Englishman. In other fields, Wendell indulged
himself in similar sentimentalities. He reacted to
the shock of the late war in the correct manner of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
State Street banker. He succumbed to the Coolidge
buncombe far back in 1920. Yet always the sharply
intelligent Wendell hauled up and stayed the orthodox
romantic. The tribute to him by Prof. Kuno
Francke, quoted by Mr. Howe, is a tribute not only to
a gentleman, but also to a man of sense. And even in
the midst of his banal speculation whether Coolidge,
after all, would not turn out to be a Yankee Lincoln, he
saw clearly the “small, hatchet-faced, colorless man,
with a tight-shut, thin-lipped mouth”—in other words,
the third-rate, small-town attorney, stuffed with copy-book
platitudes and quite without imagination. He
saw, too, the truth about Wilson, and stated it blisteringly
in a letter to his friend R. W. Curtis.</p>

<p>Wendell’s actual books, I believe, are now all dead,
even his arbitrary and ignorant but highly amusing
“Literary History of America.” His volume on
Shakespeare, published in 1894, is admired by Sir
Arthur Quiller-Couch and Mrs. Edith Wharton, but
no one else seems to remember it. His novels and
dramas are long forgotten. His “English Composition”
was and is a school-book; he himself, in his old
age, had doubts that it had accomplished even its
pedagogic purpose. His political essays, once so
salacious, now read like the heresies of the Jefferson
era. What remains, then, of Prof. Barrett Wendell,
A.B., Litt.D.? A great deal more, I believe, than
a mere ghost. When, indeed, the roll of American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
literati is drawn up at last, and the high deeds of
each are set down, it will be found that Wendell, too,
did something, and that what he did was of considerable
importance. In a few words, he helped to divert
criticism from books to life itself—he was one
of the first to see that mere literature is, after all,
mere literature—that it cannot be understood without
knowing something about the society which produced
it. Even Poe, masterly critic that he was, overlooked
this obvious and all-important fact. His discussion
of books went on in a sort of vacuum. He
had brilliant (and often sound) opinions about every
technical problem imaginable, and about every question
of taste, but only too often he overlooked the fact
that his author was also a man, and that what the
author wrote the man had first to think, feel and endure.
Wendell got rid of that narrow bookishness,
still lingering in Lowell. He was primarily a critic,
not of literary manners and postures, but of human
existence under the Republic. There was no scholarly
affectation about him, for all his superficial play-acting,
his delight in impressing sophomores. He
did not bury his nose in books; he went out and looked
at the world, and what he saw there amused him
immensely and filled him with ideas. In Mr. Howe’s
index the name of Longfellow appears but once, and
that of Gilder but once, and that of Aldrich not at all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
but that of Blaine is there six times, and after Democracy
there are twenty-two entries.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this break with the old American
tradition had its high uses, and has left its mark
upon American letters. Criticism among us is vastly
less cloistered than it once was. Even professors
of the loftiest tone, if they would have themselves attended
to, must descend from their ivory towers and
show themselves at the sea-level. The aloof and austere
spirit is now viewed with suspicion. There are,
I daresay, ancients who deplore the change. A natural
regret, for it has made criticism vastly more
difficult. But few deplore it, I believe, who know
what literature really is—few, that is, who know the
difference between mere intellectual prettiness and a
body of living ideas.</p>

<p>As for Wendell’s amazing contradictions and inconsistencies,
his endless flounderings between orthodoxy
and heresy, I believe that an adequate explanation
of them is to be found in the compositions of
Prof. Dr. Sigmund Freud, the Viennese necromancer.
Freud, himself a Jew, discusses in one of his books
the curious fact that jokes at the expense of the Jews
are chiefly circulated by Jews themselves, and especially
by the younger ones. Two Jewish drummers in
a Pullman smoking-room fall into an exchange of
such jocosities almost automatically. Why? Because,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
says Freud, they attain thereby to an escape
from their Jewishness, which often irks them. It is
not they are ashamed of being Jews; it is that
the Jewish practices of their elders are burdensome.
They dare not revolt openly, for their sense of filial
piety is strong, so they take it out by making jokes.
By much the same psychological process, I believe,
Wendell arrived at his curious mixture of contrarieties.
Sentimentally and emotionally, he was
moved powerfully by the New England tradition, and
felt a strong impulse to defend it against the world.
Intellectually, he saw clearly that it was in collapse
around him—worse, that it had been full of defects
and weaknesses even when, by his own doctrine, it had
been strong. The result was his endless shuttling between
worship and ribaldry. The last of the New
Englanders, he clung pathetically to a faith which
gradually succumbed to doubts. In his later years he
thus stood upon a burning deck, whence all but him
had fled.</p>

<p>Two things, for all his skepticism, he could never
bring himself to admit formally, both obvious: first,
that the so-called culture of Puritan New England was
largely imaginary, that civilization was actually introduced
into the region by anti-Puritans, and second,
that when Transcendentalism came in, the leadership
of Puritanism passed from New England and went
to the South and Middle West. To admit the truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
of either proposition was psychically impossible to a
man of his romantic feelings. Each, baldly stated,
seemed to flout the local Holy Ghost. And yet both
were true, and their proofs were visible at a glance.
The first, I daresay, will never be granted formally,
or even heard patiently, by any genuine New Englander.
Only a short while ago Walter Prichard
Eaton, a very able Puritan, was arguing eloquently
that his blue-nosed ancestors were really lovers of
beauty, nay, downright artists—and offering the
charming old houses on Nantucket Island as exhibits.
Unfortunate examples, alas, alas! The houses on
Nantucket were not built until the Puritan theocracy
was completely demoralized and impotent—until
Boston had a theatre, and was already two-thirds of
the way to hell. And if they were actually built by
Puritans at all, then it was by Puritans who had gone
out into the wide, wide word and savored its dreadful
and voluptuous marvels—Puritans who had come
back from the Eastern seas with gaudy silks in their
sea-chests, and the perfume of strange gals upon their
whiskers, and a new glitter to their eyes.</p>

<p>Orthodox history, at least as it appears in school-books,
assumes that the witch-burners and infant-damners
had it all their own way in New England,
even down to Revolutionary times. They actually
met with sturdy opposition from the start. All of
their sea-ports gradually filled up with sailors who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
were anything but pious Christian men, and even the
back-country had its heretics, as the incessant wars
upon them demonstrate. The fact that only Puritans
could vote in the towns has deceived the historians;
they mistake what was the law for what was really
said and done. We have had proofs in our own time
that that error is easy. Made by students of early
New England, it leads to multiple absurdities. The
fact is that the civilization that grew up in the region,
such as it was, owed very little to the actual Puritans;
it was mainly the product of anti-Puritans, either
home-bred or imported. Even the school system, so
celebrated in legend, owed whatever value was in it
to what were currently regarded as criminals. The
Puritans did not found their schools for the purpose
of propagating what is now known as learning; they
found them simply as nurseries of orthodoxy. Beyond
the barest rudiments nothing of any worldly
value was taught in them. The principal subject of
study, first and last, was theology, and it was theology
of the most grotesque and insane sort ever
cherished by man. Genuine education began in
New England only when the rising minority of anti-Puritans,
eventually to become a majority, rose
against this theology, and tried to put it down. The
revolt was first felt at Harvard; it gradually converted
a seminary for the training of Puritan pastors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
into a genuine educational institution. Harvard delivered
New England, and made civilization possible
there. All the men who adorned that civilization in
the days of its glory—Emerson, Hawthorne and all
the rest of them—were essentially anti-Puritans.</p>

<p>To-day, save in its remoter villages, New England
is no more Puritan than, say, Maryland or Missouri.
There is scarcely a clergyman in the entire region
who, if the Mathers could come back to life, would
not be condemned by them instantly as a heretic, and
even as an atheist. The dominant theology is mild,
skeptical and wholly lacking in passion. The evangelical
spirit has completely disappeared. Save in
a small minority of atavistic fanatics, there is a tolerance
that is almost indistinguishable from indifference.
Roman Catholicism and Christian Science
are alike viewed amiably. The old heat is gone.
Where it lingers in America is in far places—on the
Methodist prairies of the Middle West, in the Baptist
back-waters of the South. There, I believe, it still
retains not a little of its old vitality. There Puritanism
survives, not merely as a system of theology, but
also as a way of life. It colors every human activity.
Kiwanis mouths it; it is powerful in politics; learning
wears its tinge. To charge a Harvard professor
of to-day with agnosticism would sound as banal as to
charge him with playing the violoncello. But his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
colleague of Kansas, facing the same accusation,
would go damp upon the forehead, and his colleague
of Texas would leave town between days.</p>

<p>Wendell, a sentimentalist, tried to put these facts
behind him, though he must have been well aware of
them. There got into his work, in consequence, a
sense of futility, even when he was discussing very
real and important things. He opened paths that he
was unable to traverse himself. Sturdier men, following
him, were soon marching far ahead of him.
He will live in the history of American criticism, but
his own criticism is already dead.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIII. THE NATION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE often hears lamentation that the American
weeklies of opinion are not as good as
their English prototypes—that we have
never produced anything in that line to equal, say,
the <i>Athenæum</i> or the <i>Saturday Review</i>. In the notion,
it seems to me, there is nothing save that melancholy
colonialism which is one of the curses of
America. The plain fact is that our weeklies, taking
one with another, are quite as well turned out as
anything that England has ever seen, and that at least
two of them, the <i>Nation</i> and the <i>New Republic</i>, are
a great deal better. They are better because they are
more hospitable to ideas, because they are served by
a wider and more various range of writers, and because
they show an occasional sense of humor. Even
the <i>New Republic</i> knows how to be waggish, though
it also knows, especially when it is discussing religion,
how to be cruelly dull. Its Washington correspondence
is better than any Parliamentary stuff
in any English weekly ever heard of, if only because
it is completely devoid of amateur statesmanship, the
traditional defect of political correspondence at all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
times and everywhere. The editors of the English
weeklies all ride political hobbies, and many of them
are actively engaged in politics. Their American
colleagues, I suspect, have been tempted in that
direction more than once, but happily they have resisted,
or maybe fate has resisted for them.</p>

<p>Of all the weeklies—and I go through at least
twenty each week, American and English, including
the Catholic <i>Commonweal</i> and a Negro journal—I
like the <i>Nation</i> best. There is something charming
about its format, and it never fails to print an interesting
piece of news, missed by the daily newspapers.
Moreover, there is always a burst of fury in it, and
somewhere or other, often hidden in a letter from a
subscriber, a flash of wit—two things that make for
amusing reading. The <i>New Republic</i>, I suspect, is
more authoritative in certain fields,—for example,
the economic—but it is also more pontifical. The
<i>Nation</i> gets the air of a lark into many of its most
violent crusades against fraud and folly; one somehow
gathers the notion that its editors really do not
expect the millennium to come in to-morrow. Of
late they have shown many signs of forsaking Liberalism
for Libertarianism—a far sounder and more
satisfying politics. A Liberal is committed to sure
cures that always turn out to be swindles; a Libertarian
throws the bottles out of the window, and asks
only that the patient be let alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>What the circulation of the <i>Nation</i> may be I don’t
know. In its sixtieth anniversary number, published
in 1925, there was a hint that the number then sold
each week ran far ahead of the 11,000 with which E.
L. Godkin began in 1865. I have heard gabble in
the saloons frequented by New York publishers that
the present circulation is above 30,000. But no one,
so far as I know, has ever suggested that it equals the
circulation of even a third-rate daily paper. Such
dull, preposterous sheets as the New York <i>Telegram</i>,
the Washington <i>Star</i>, the Philadelphia <i>Public Ledger</i>
and the Atlanta <i>Constitution</i> sell two or three times
as many copies. Such magazines for the herd as
<i>True Stories</i> and <i>Hot Dog</i> sell fifty times as many.
Nevertheless, if I were a fellow of public spirit and
eager to poison the Republic with my sagacity, I’d
rather be editor of the <i>Nation</i> than editor of any of
the other journals that I have mentioned—nay, I’d
rather be editor of the <i>Nation</i> than editor of all of
them together, with every other newspaper and magazine
in America, save perhaps four or five, thrown
in. For the <i>Nation</i> is unique in American journalism
for one thing: it is read by its enemies. They
may damn it, they may have it barred from libraries,
they may even—as they did during the war—try to
have it put down by the Postoffice, but all the while
they read it. That is, the more intelligent of them—the
least hopeless minority of them. It is to such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
minorities that the <i>Nation</i> addresses itself, on both
sides of the fence. It has penetrated to the capital
fact that they alone count—that the ideas sneaked
into them to-day will begin to sweat out of the herd
day after to-morrow.</p>

<p>Is the Creel Press Bureau theory of the late war
abandoned? Is it impossible to find an educated
man who is not ashamed that he succumbed to the
Wilson buncombe? Then thank the <i>Nation</i> for that
deliverance, for when it tackled Wilson it tackled
him alone. Is the Coolidge Golden Age beginning
to be sicklied o’er with a pale cast of green? Then
prepare to thank the <i>Nation</i> again, for it began to tell
the harsh, cold truth about good Cal at a time when
all the daily journals of America, with not ten exceptions,
were competing for the honor of shining his
shoes. I often wonder, indeed, that the great success
of the <i>Nation</i> under Villard has made such little impression
upon American journalists—that they are so
dead to the lessons that it roars into their ears. They
all read it—that is, all who read anything at all. It
prints news every week that they can’t find in their
own papers—sometimes news of the very first importance.
It comments upon that news in a tart and
well-informed fashion. It presents all the new
ideas that rage in the world, always promptly and often
pungently. To an editorial writer the <i>Nation</i> is
indispensable. Either he reads it, or he is an idiot.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
Yet its example is very seldom followed—that is,
forthrightly and heartily. Editorial writers all over
the land steal ideas from it daily; it supplies, indeed,
all the ideas that most of them ever have. It lifts
them an inch, two inches, three inches, above the sedimentary
stratum of Rotarians, bankers and ice-wagon
drivers; they are conscious of its pull even when they
resist. Yet very few of them seem to make the inevitable
deduction that the kind of journalism it
practices is better and more effective than the common
kind—that they, too, might amount to something
in this world if they would imitate it.</p>

<p>In such matters, alas, change is very slow. The
whole press of the United States, I believe, is moving
in the direction of the <i>Nation</i>—that is, in the direction
of independence and honesty. Even such papers
as the New York <i>Herald-Tribune</i> are measurably
less stupid and intransigeant than they used to
be, in their news if not in their opinions. But the
majority of active journalists in the higher ranks were
bred on the old-time party organs, and it is very difficult
for them to reform their ways. They still think,
not as free men, but as party hacks. On the one side
they put the truth; on the other side they put what
they call policy. Thus there are thousands of them
who still sit down nightly to praise Coolidge—though
to the best of my knowledge and belief there is not a
single journalist in the whole United States who ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
speaks of Coolidge in private without sneering at him.
This resistance to change grows all the more curious
when one observes what happens to the occasional
paper which abandons it. I offer the Baltimore
<i>Sunpaper</i> as an example—an especially apposite one,
for the influence of the <i>Nation</i> upon it must be apparent
to everyone familiar with its recent history.
It was, a dozen years ago, a respectable but immensely
dull journal. It presented the day’s news in
a formal, unintelligent fashion. It was accurate in
small things, and free from sensationalism, but it
seldom if ever went beyond the overt event to the
causes and motives behind it. Its editorial opinions
were flabby, and without influence. To-day it is certainly
something far different. It must still go a
long, long way, I suspect, before it escapes its old
self altogether, but that must be a dull reader, indeed,
who cannot see how vastly it has improved. It
no longer prints the news formally; it devotes immense
energy to discovering and revealing what is
behind the news. In opinion it has thrown off all
chains of faction and party, and is sharply and
often intelligently independent. Its reaction to a
new public problem is not that of a party hack, but
that of a free man. It is, perhaps, sometimes
grossly wrong, but no sane person believes that it is
ever deliberately disingenuous.</p>

<p>Well, the point is that this new scheme has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
tremendously successful—that it has paid in hard
cash as well as in the usufructs of the spirit. There
is no sign that the readers of the <i>Sunpaper</i>—barring
a few quacks with something to sell—dislike its new
vigor, enterprise and independence. On the contrary,
there is every evidence that they like it. They have
increased greatly in numbers. The paper itself rises
in dignity and influence. And every other newspaper
in America that ventures upon the same innovations,
from the <i>World</i> in New York to the <i>Enquirer-Sun</i>
down in Columbus, Ga., rises in the same way. It is
my contention that the <i>Nation</i> has led the way in this
reform of American journalism—that it will be followed
by many papers to-morrow, as it is followed by
a few to-day. Its politics are sometimes outrageous.
It frequently gets into lamentable snarls, battling for
liberty with one hand and more laws with the other.
It is doctrinaire, inconsistent, bellicose. It whoops
for men one day, and damns them as frauds the next.
It has no sense of decorum. It is sometimes a bit
rowdy. But who will deny that it is honest? And
who will deny that, taking one day with another, it
is generally right—that its enthusiasms, if they occasionally
send it mooning after dreamers, at least
never send it cheering for rogues—that its wrongness,
when it is wrong, is at all events not the dull,
simian wrongness of mere stupidity? It is disliked
inordinately, but not, I believe, by honest men, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
among its enemies. It is disliked by demagogues
and exploiters, by frauds great and small. They
have all tasted its snickersnee, and they have all good
reason to dislike it.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not subscribe to its politics, save
when it advocates liberty openly and unashamed. I
have no belief in politicians: the good ones and the
bad ones seem to me to be unanimously thieves. Thus
I hope I may whoop for it with some grace, despite
the fact that my name appears on its flagstaff. How
my name got there I don’t know; I receive no emolument
from its coffers, and write for it very seldom,
and then only in contravention of its ideas. I even
have to pay cash for my annual subscription—a
strange and painful burden for a journalist to bear.
But I know of no other expenditure (that is, of a
secular character) that I make with more satisfaction,
or that brings me a better return. Most of the papers
that I am doomed to read are idiotic even when they
are right. The <i>Nation</i> is intelligent and instructive
even when it is wrong.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIV. OFFICERS AND
GENTLEMEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HARD luck pursues the American Navy. It
is the common butt, not only of political
mountebanks, but also of all the brummagem
uplifters and soul-snatchers who now sweat to
save us. If a Mr. Secretary Denby is not permitting
the Falls and Dohenys to raid its goods, a Mr. Secretary
Wilbur or Josephus Daniels is trying to convert
it into a Methodist Sunday-school. Worse, the Navy
gets more than its fair share of the national dirty
work. It is told off to put down free speech in the
Virgin Islands, and it is delegated to flog, hang and
butcher the poor Haitians, and so convert them into
black Iowans, with money in the bank. Elsewhere in
the world such disagreeable jobs are given to the
Army. The British Army, for example, performs all
the massacres that are necessary in India, and the
French Army attends to whatever routine murders and
mayhems are called for in Syria and Morocco. But
the American custom puts all such Christian endeavor
upon the Navy.</p>

<p>However, unless my agents lie, it is not the gore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
that revolts the more high-toned naval officers, but the
new rectitude that has been thrust upon them. They
are, as a class, excellent fellows, and full of pride in
their uniform. As officers, they are all theoretically
gentlemen, and many of them are so in fact. They
have traveled widely, and are familiar with the
usages of the civilized world. They know what is decent
and seemly. Well, try to imagine how they must
feel when they read the daily papers. One day they
read that the Secretary of the Navy has ordered a
group of their colleagues to prosecute a woman nurse
for bringing in a couple of jugs aboard a naval collier.
The next day they observe that a high officer in
the Marines has filled the newspapers with a meticulous
and indignant account of what went on at a table
where he was a guest, in the house of one of his subordinates.
Explanations of this last episode have
been offered, but they certainly do not explain it
away. The essential and immovable point is that one
officer snitched on another, his host—that the immemorial
and invariable obligations of a guest were
sacrificed to Law Enforcement. What would happen
to an English naval officer who made any such assault
upon the code? What, indeed would happen to an
honest Elk?</p>

<p>But I am not arguing here that any such things
ought to happen; I am merely calling attention to the
fact that, under democracy, it is becoming increasingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
difficult for officers to be gentlemen, as the
term is commonly understood in the world, and perhaps
also increasingly improbable. We are, it would
appear, passing through a time of changing values,
and what was considered decent by our fathers will
lose that quality to-morrow. The lower orders of
men, having attained to political power, now proceed
to force their ideas upon their betters, and some
of those ideas naturally have to do with decorum.
It is already unlawful in America to take a bottle of
wine to a sick friend; in a few years it may also be
indelicate. And simultaneously, it may become quite
proper to go to the police with anything that is said
or done in a friend’s house. Personally, I am inclined
to oppose such changes, if only in sheer hunkerousness,
but I am surely under no illusion that opposing
them will stop them. They flow naturally
out of the character of the common man, now in the
saddle, and are thus irresistible. He is extremely
and even excessively moral, but the concept of what
is called honor is beyond him. If, for example, he
aspires to public office, he believes that it is entirely
proper to abandon one conviction and take on its
opposite in order to get votes. And, having got into
office, he believes that it is entirely proper to hold
on at any cost, even at the cost of common decency.</p>

<p>There is a familiar example. I allude to the
Cathcart case. In that case a high officer of State<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
found himself confronting an uncomfortable dilemma.
On the one hand he was bound by an outrageous
law to engage in a public and obscene chase
of a woman taken in adultery. On the other hand he
was bound by the code of all civilized men to refuse
and refrain. What was the way out for him? The
way out, obviously, was for him to resign his office—in
other words, to decline flatly to perform any
such ignoble and disgusting duty, and to spurn as
insults the honors and emoluments offered for doing
it. But, as far as I can make out, he never so much
as thought of that. Instead he played the bounder—and
kept his dirty job. His conduct, I believe,
seemed quite proper to the overwhelming majority
of his countrymen. The newspapers, in discussing
it, never once suggested that a man of honor, in his
boots, would resign forthwith. Instead, they simply
denounced him for doing his plain duty under the
law—that is, they proposed that he get out of his
dilemma by violating his oath of office. The device
is characteristically American. Anything is fair and
decent that keeps a man his job. That has been the
settled American doctrine since Jackson’s time.</p>

<p>But it is only of late, I believe, that it has been
defended openly, and its antithesis denounced as, in
some mysterious fashion, inimical to democracy.
We owe that change to the liberation of the lower
orders which began with the Civil War. That liberation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
produced, on one side, an immense increase
in political corruption, and, on the other, a rise in
moral frenzy. All the characteristic ideas of the
mob began to be reflected in public life and legislation.
The typical American public officer, who had
been a theorist willing to sacrifice anything, including
his office, to his notions, became a realist willing
to sacrifice anything, including his principles and
his honor, to his job. We have him with us to-day,
and he smells worse and worse as year chases year.
Grover Cleveland was perhaps the last lonely survivor
of the old days. He had his faults, God knows,
but no one could have imagined him yielding to the
mob in order to make votes. Right or wrong, he
was his own man—and never more surely than when,
by popular standards, he was wrong. In his successor,
Dr. Coolidge, we have an almost perfect specimen
of the new order. Coolidge is a professional
trimmer, who has made his living at the art since
his early manhood. It is impossible to imagine him
sacrificing his political welfare to his convictions.
He has vanity, but nothing properly describable as
dignity or self-respect. One automatically pictures
him doing, in the Cathcart case, precisely what his
subordinate did. He performed many comparable
acts during the stinking progress of the Fall case.</p>

<p>This general decay of honor is bound, plainly
enough, to drive all the decenter sort of men out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
public life among us. The process, indeed, has already
gone a long way. I point to Congress. I point
to the Federal judiciary. In both directions one observes
an increase in trimmers and knee-benders and
a decrease in independent and self-respecting men.
The bench, in particular, has suffered. The better
sort of judges, torn between their lawyer-like respect
for all law and their inescapable conviction that many
of the new laws they are called upon to enforce are
unjust and dishonest, tend to throw off the ermine
and go back to practice. And their places are filled
by limber nonentities selected—and policed—by the
Anti-Saloon League.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago the Army and the Navy escaped
this general degradation. Their officers stood
apart from the main body of public job-holders.
They held office for life, and they were assumed to
be innocent of politics. Having no need to curry
favor with the mob, they could afford to disdain the
common hypocrisies. Inheriting an austere and exact
tradition of professional honor, they were what is
called gentlemen. They did not blab upon one another.
They had the fine tolerance of civilized men.
They had dignity. It was as impossible to imagine
a naval officer or an army officer playing the spy for
the Anti-Saloon League as it was to imagine him using
a table-napkin as a handkerchief or getting converted
at a Methodist revival. But I fear those days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
are past. The pressure from outside, exerted through
such mountebanks as Mr. Secretary Wilbur, becomes
too heavy to be borne. Worse, there is disintegration
within, due in part, perhaps, to the packing of
the two Services with civilians from the gutter, but
in part also to changes in the method of selecting
candidates for Annapolis and West Point. Whatever
the cause, the effects are already plain. In a few
short years, perhaps, we shall see a major-general in
the Army preaching Fundamentalism in Tennessee,
and an admiral in the Navy going to work for the
Anti-Saloon League.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XV. GOLDEN AGE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE rest of us, struggling onward painfully,
must wait in patience for the boons and usufructs
of Heaven; Judge Elbert Henry Gary,
LL.D., chairman of the United States Steel Corporation,
has them here and now. To few men in history,
I believe, has it been given to live in a universe
so nearly to their hearts’ desire. Let the learned
ex-jurist look East or West, he will find only scenes
to content him. Let him look North or South, and
his eye will be caressed and frankincense will spray
his gills. The emperor and pope of all the Babbitts,
he sits at the center of a Babbitts’ paradise. For him
and his like there dawns a Golden Age, and its hero
is good Cal.</p>

<p>I hope I do not exaggerate. No doubt Judge
Gary, in the privacy of his chamber, sweats and
fumes against imperfections invisible to the rest of
us. He is a man of imagination, and has, I daresay,
a bold and soaring fancy. He can imagine a Republic
even kinder and more osculatory than this one—that
is, to Babbitts. He can even, perhaps, imagine a
President more ineffable than Cal. But here we shoot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
into mere human weaknesses—the voluptuous, Freudian
day-dreams of one who, like all of us, has his
aberrant, goatish moods. Dr. John Roach Straton, I
suppose, can imagine improvements in the Holy Scriptures—here
a paragraph excised <i>pro bonos mores</i>,
there a comma inserted to make sense. I myself
have dreamed of a malt liquor better than Pilsner
Bürgerbräu. But I do not sign my name to such inordinate
speculations, and neither does Dr. Straton.
Judge Gary, too, holds his tongue. The rest of us,
contemplating him, can only envy him. A vast nation
of 110,000,000 human beings, all of them alike,
seems to be organized to the one end of making him
happy. Whatever he wants it to do, it does. Its
laws are framed to his precise taste; its public conscience
approves his partisans and execrates his enemies;
its high officers of state are his excellent
friends, and humble and obedient servants. When
he gives a feast, judges and ambassadors leap to
grace it. When he would dine out, he is welcome at
the White House. The newspapers fawn upon him.
Labor licks his hand. His frown is dreaded in the
Senate house and on the bench. Altogether, his life
is happier than that of a Broadway actor, and if he is
not content then it is only because contentment is
physiologically impossible to <i>Homo sapiens</i>.</p>

<p>The United States, I believe, is the first great empire
in the history of the world to ground its whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
national philosophy upon business. There have
been, of course, eminent trading nations in the past,
but none ever went so far. Even in Carthage there
was a <i>Junker</i> hierarchy that stood above the merchants;
in Hannibal it actually had a Crown Prince.
And even in England, the nation of shopkeepers of
Napoleon’s derision, there has always been an aristocracy
(made up mainly of military freebooters, enterprising
adulterers, the issue of the latter, and, in
modern times, shyster lawyers, vaudeville magnates,
and the proprietors of yellow newspapers) that has
held its own against the men of trade, even at the cost
of absorbing the more pugnacious of them. But
here in this great Republic of the West the art of trafficking
is king—and Judge Gary is its grand vizier,
as Cal is its chief eunuch. No other human activity
brings such great rewards in money and power, and
none is more lavishly honored. The one aim of our
jurisprudence is to safeguard business—to make its
risks small and its profits sure. If the rights of the
citizen get in the way, then the rights of the citizen
must be sacrificed. Upon this point our higher courts
have delivered themselves more than once, and in
eloquent, ringing terms. Judge Gary and his friends
prefer dry and dismal slaves to those who are
stewed and happy. <i>Also</i>, to hell with the Bill of
Rights! They prefer, when there is a strike, to win
it rather than lose it. Out, then, with the pad of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
blank injunctions! They sweat under criticism, and
shiver under attack. To the hoosegow, constable,
with the Bolsheviks!</p>

<p>All this, of course, was not achieved without a
struggle. For years the Constitution stood in the
way—the Constitution and certain national superstitions—the
latter sprung from the blather of the
Revolutionary stump. But all those impediments are
now surmounted. The bench gave Judge Gary to
business, and business has reciprocated the favor by
providing sound and sane men for the bench.
To-day jurisprudence is unfettered. When, a year
or so ago, the Supreme Court finally got rid of the
Fourth Amendment, that delayed mopping up went
almost unnoticed. As I say, Judge Gary, ought to be
a happy man. The sun shines upon him from all
four points of the compass. Congress, well rehearsed,
plays soft jazz for him; bishops bring him
his toddy; a straw issues from the White House and
tickles him behind the ear. But never is his happiness
greater, I believe, than when his thoughts turn
idly upon the subject of labor, and he contemplates the
state of the union movement in the Federal Union.</p>

<p>For this state, it is plain, he has the late Sam
Gompers to thank—that great idealist and easy mark.
If he sent less than ten hay-wagons of roses to Sam’s
funeral, then he is a niggard, indeed. For Sam got
upon the back of the American labor movement when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
it was beginning to be dangerous, and rode it so
magnificently that at the end of his life it was as tame
as a tabby cat. It retains that character to-day, and
will continue to do so as long as the Gompersian hierarchy
lasts,—that is, so long as Judge Gary and his
friends continue to appoint Sam’s heirs and assigns
to high-sounding committees, and to invite them to
gaudy dinners. A plate of puddle duck and a chance
to make a speech—that was always enough to fetch
Sam. And when Sam was fetched, the 4,000,000
members of the American Federation of Labor were
also fetched. Where else in the world is there a
great union organization that has so long and honorable
a record as a strike-breaker? Or that is so
diligently devoted to keeping the lower ranks of labor
in due subordination? If it had been conceived and
hatched by Judge Gary himself, it could not have been
more nearly perfect. Practically considered, it is
not a labor organization at all; it is simply a balloon
mattress interposed between capital and labor to
protect the former from the latter. Gazing upon it,
I daresay, Judge Gary feels a glow flickering along
the periphery of his gizzard, and if he were not a
Christian he would permit himself a guffaw.</p>

<p>I leave the sweetest to the last. The courts might
be docile, Congress might be consecrated to right
thought, labor might grovel and the bench of bishops
might applaud, but if there were an anarchist in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
the White House it would all go for naught.
Imagine, then, Judge Gary’s joy in contemplating the
incomparable Cal! It is almost as if, in New York,
a bootlegger were made king. The man’s merits, in
the Babbitt view, are almost fabulous. He seems,
indeed, scarcely like a man at all, but more like
some miraculous visitation or act of God. He is
the ideal made visible, if not audible—perfection put
into a cutaway coat and trotted up and down like a
mannequin in a cloak and suit atelier. Nor was
there any long stress of training him—no season of
doubt and misgiving. Nature heaved him forth full-blown,
like a new star shot into the heavens. In him
the philosophy of Babbitt comes to its perfect and
transcendental form. Thrift, to him, is the queen of
all the virtues. He respects money in each and every
one of its beautiful forms—pennies, nickels, dimes,
dollars, five-dollar bills, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. He
venerates those who have it. He believes that they
have wisdom. He craves the loan and use of that
wisdom. He invites them to breakfast, and listens to
them. The things they revere, he reveres. The
things they long for, he longs to give them.</p>

<p>Judge Gary is an old man—just how old I do not
know, for he withholds the date of his birth from
“Who’s Who in America,” along with the principal
suffragettes. He remembers the dreadful days of
Roosevelt, with bombs going off every two hours.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
He remembers the turmoils of the Taft administration.
He remembers how <i>difficile</i> Woodrow was—how
he had to be wooed, flattered, led by the nose,
drenched with goose-grease. He remembers the
crude carnival under the martyr Harding—Broadway
sports, pug managers, small-town Elks at the trough.
And then he thinks of Washington to-day, and sees it
bathed in pink sunshine. There he is ever welcome.
There he is <i>imperator in imperio</i>. There is good
<i>Geschäft</i>. There is the Athens of the new Golden
Age.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVI. EDGAR SALTUS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FORTY years ago Edgar Saltus was a shining
star in the national literature, leading the
way out of the Egyptian night of Victorian
sentimentality. To-day he survives only as the
favorite author of the late Warren Gamaliel Harding.
I can recall, in the circle of Athene, no more complete
collapse. Saltus plunged from the top of the world
to the bottom of the sea. His books, of late, have
been reissued, and his surviving third wife has
printed a biography of him. But all his old following,
save for a few romantic die-hards, has vanished.</p>

<p>The causes of the débâcle are certainly not hard to
determine. They were set forth twenty-five years ago
by that ingenious man, the late Percival Pollard, and
you will find them in his book, “Their Day in Court.”
Saltus was simply a bright young fellow who succumbed
to his own cleverness. The gaudy glittering
phrase enchanted him. He found early in life that
he had a hand for shaping it; he found soon afterward
that it had a high capacity for getting him notice.
So he devoted himself to its concoction—and presently
he was lost. His life after that was simply one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
long intoxication. He was drunk on words. Ideas
gradually departed from him. Day and night, for
years and years, he held his nozzle against the jug of
nouns, adjectives, verbs, pronouns, prepositions and
interjections. Some of his phrases, of course, were
good ones. There were enough of that kind in
“Imperial Purple,” for example, to fascinate the
sainted Harding, a voluptuary in all the arts. But
the rest quickly wore out—and with them Saltus himself
wore out. He passed into the shadows, and was
forgotten. When he died, a few years ago, all that
remained of him was a vague name.</p>

<p>His wife’s biography is encased in an orange slip-cover
which announces melodramatically that it is
“an extraordinary revealing life.” It is, but I doubt
that what it reveals will serve to resuscitate poor
Saltus. The man who emerges from it is simply a
silly and hollow trifler—a mass of puerile pretensions
and affectations, vain of his unsound knowledge and
full of sentimentalities. He began life by hawking
the stale ribaldries of Arthur Schopenhauer, already
dead twenty years; he departed to realms of bliss
chattering the blowsy nonsense of theosophy. Mrs.
Saltus, in the new and appalling fashion of literary
wives, is extremely frank. Her Edgar was a handsome
dog, but extremely foolish, and even childish.
When he was engaged upon his rococo compositions
he had to be protected like a queen bee in childbed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
The slightest sound dissipated his inspiration, and set
him to yelling. If a fish-peddler stopped beneath
his window he was done for the day. If a cat came
in and brushed his leg he was thrown into hysterics,
and had to go to bed. His love affairs were highly
complex, and apparently took up a great deal of his
time. Early in life, while he was a student at Heidelberg,
he had an affair with a lady of noble birth,
and even ran away with her. The business was
quickly broken up, apparently by the allied sovereigns
of Europe. The bride-elect was immured in a convent,
and died there “the year following.” Saltus
then came back to the Republic and married the
daughter of a partner in J. P. Morgan &amp; Company.
“She was no small catch,” but the alliance was
doomed. The man was too fascinating to women.
His pulchritude charmed them, and his epigrams
finished them. In a few years Mrs. Saltus was suing
for divorce.</p>

<p>There followed a series of morganatic affairs, culminating
in a second marriage. This one also blew
up quickly; the bride denounced Saltus as a liar, and
even hinted that he had induced her to marry him by
fraud. But though she soon left his bed and board,
she clung resolutely to her other rights as his wife,
and thereafter, for many long years, he devoted all
the time he could spare from his writing to efforts to
get rid of her. He moved from New York to California,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
in fact, mainly because the divorce laws on the
Coast were easier than in the East. But they were
not easy enough to free him. Finally, after endless
waiting, he got news one day that the party of the
second part was dead. He displayed the correct
regrets, but was obviously much relieved. Meanwhile,
Wife No. 3 was at call in the anteroom. She
had been there, in fact, for years. When Saltus first
met her she was a school-girl with her hair down her
back, and his attentions to her—he was then rising
forty—naturally outraged her family. But her own
heart was lost, and so the effort to warn him off failed.
He followed her, after that, all over the civilized
world. Did she go to London, he was at her heels
on the next steamer. Did she move to Los Angeles,
he arrived by the next train. In the end they were
married in Montreal, on a very hot day and after a
pretty lovers’ quarrel.</p>

<p>This lady is the author of the biography with the
orange slip-cover. Facing page 310 there is a portrait
of her showing her “sitting at the table on which
her husband wrote his books, burning incense before
a Siamese Buddha, and meditating on a stanza from
the Bhagavad-Gita.” She denies, however, that Saltus
took to theosophy under her tutelage. The actual recruiting
officer was a certain Mr. Colville, of Pasadena,
who combined the “enthusiasm of a scholar and
the erudition of a sage.” This Colville introduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
Saltus to the theosophical elements, and later guided
his faltering steps. In the end poor old Schopenhauer
lost a customer and the art of epigram a gifted
and diligent practitioner. Saltus passed into senility
with his thoughts concentrated powerfully upon
Higher Things.</p>

<p>A grotesque and somewhat pathetic story. The
man began life with everything in his favor. His
family was well-to-do and of good social position in
New York; he was sent to Eton and then to Heidelberg,
and apparently made useful friends at both
places; he plunged into writing at the precise moment
when revolt against the New England Brahmins was
rising; he attracted attention quickly, and was given
a lavish welcome. No American author of 1885 was
more talked about. When his first novel, “The Truth
About Tristrem Varick,” came out in 1888 it made a
genuine sensation. But the stick came down almost
as fast as the rocket had gone up. His books set the
nation agog for a short while, and were then quietly
forgotten. He began as the hope of American letters,
and ended as a writer of yellow-backs and a special
correspondent for the Hearst papers. What ailed
him was simply lack of solid substance. He could be
clever, as cleverness was understood during the first
Cleveland administration, but he lacked dignity, information,
sense. His books of “philosophy” were
feeble and superficial, his novels were only facile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
improvisations, full of satanic melodrama and wooden
marionettes.</p>

<p>Of late I have been re-reading them—a sad job,
surely, for when I was a schoolboy they were nine-day
wonders, barred from all the libraries but devoured
eagerly by every aspiring youth. Now their
epigrams are dulled, and there is nothing else left.
“The Anatomy of Negation” and “The Philosophy of
Disenchantment” have been superseded by far better
books; “The Truth About Tristrem Varick” reads like
one of the shockers of Gertrude Atherton; “Mary
Magdalen” is a dead shell; the essays and articles
republished as “Uplands of Dream” are simply
ninth-rate journalism. Of them all only “Imperial
Purple” holds up. A certain fine glow is still in it;
it has gusto if not profundity; Saltus’s worst faults
do not damage it appreciably. I find myself, indeed,
agreeing thoroughly with the literary judgment of Dr.
Harding. “Imperial Purple” remains Saltus’s best
book. It remains also, alas, his only good one!</p>

<i>Martyrs</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">TO die for an idea: it is unquestionably noble.
But how much nobler it would be if men died
for ideas that were true! Searching history,
I can find no such case. All the great martyrs of the
books died for sheer nonsense—often for trivial matters
of doctrine and ceremonial, too absurd to be
stated in plain terms. But what of the countless thousands
who have perished in the wars, fighting magnificently
for their country? Well, show me one who
knew precisely what the war he died in was about,
and could put it into a simple and plausible proposition.</p>

<h3>2<br>

<i>The Ancients</i></h3>

<p>The theory that the ancient Greeks and Romans
were men of a vast and ineffable superiority runs
aground on the fact that they were great admirers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
of oratory. No other art was so assiduously practiced
among them. To-day we venerate the architecture
of Greece far more than we venerate its
orators, but the Greeks themselves put the orators
first, and so much better records of them are preserved
to-day. But oratory, as a matter of fact,
is the most primitive and hence the lowest of all the
arts. Where is it most respected to-day? Among
savages, in and out of civilization. The yokels of
the open spaces flock by the thousand to hear imbeciles
yawp and heave; the city proletariat glues
its ears to the radio every night. But what genuinely
civilized man would turn out to hear even the champion
orator of the country? Dozens of the most eminent
professors of the art show off their tricks every
day in the United States Senate. Yet the galleries of
the Senate, save when news goes out that some Senator
is stewed and about to make an ass of himself, are
occupied only by Negroes who have come in to get
warm, and hand-holding bridal couples from rural
North Carolina and West Virginia.</p>

<i>Jack Ketch as Eugenist</i></h3>

<p>Has any historian ever noticed the salubrious effect,
on the English character, of the frenzy for hanging
that went on in England during the Eighteenth Century?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
When I say salubrious, of course, I mean
in the purely social sense. At the end of the Seventeenth
Century the Englishman was still one of the
most turbulent and lawless of civilized men; at the
beginning of the Nineteenth he was the most law-abiding;
<i>i. e.</i>, the most docile. What worked the
change in him? I believe that it was worked by the
rope of Jack Ketch. During the Eighteenth Century
the lawless strain was simply choked out of the race.
Perhaps a third of those in whose veins it ran were
actually hanged; the rest were chased out of the
British Isles, never to return. Some fled to Ireland,
and revivified the decaying Irish race: in practically
all the Irish rebels of the past century there have been
plain traces of English blood. Others went to the
Dominions. Yet others came to the United States,
and after helping to conquer the Western wilderness,
begat the yeggman, Prohibition agents, footpads and
hijackers of to-day.</p>

<p>The murder rate is very low in England, perhaps
the lowest in the world. It is low because nearly
all the potential ancestors of murderers were hanged
or exiled in the Eighteenth Century. Why is it so
high in the United States? Because most of the potential
ancestors of murderers, in the late Eighteenth
and early Nineteenth Centuries, were <i>not</i>
hanged. And why did they escape? For two plain
reasons. First, the existing government was too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
weak to track them down and execute them, especially
in the West. Second, the qualities of daring and
enterprise that went with their murderousness were
so valuable that it was socially profitable to overlook
their homicides. In other words, the job of occupying
and organizing the vast domain of the new Republic
was one that demanded the aid of men who, among
other things, occasionally butchered their fellow men.
The butchering had to be winked at in order to get
their help. Thus the murder rate, on the frontier,
rose to unprecedented heights, while the execution
rate remained very low. Probably 100,000 men
altogether were murdered in the territory west of the
Ohio between 1776 and 1865; probably not 100
murderers were formally executed. When they were
punished at all, it was by other murderers—and this
left the strain unimpaired.</p>

<h3>4<br>

<i>Heroes</i></h3>

<p>Of human eminence there are obviously two varieties:
that which issues out of the inner substance
of the eminent individual and that which comes to
him, either partially or wholly, from without. It is
not difficult to recognize men at the two extremes. No
sane person would argue seriously that the eminence
of such a man, say, as Richard Wagner was, in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
plausible sense, accidental or unearned. Wagner
created “Tristan und Isolde” out of his own inherent
substance. Allowing everything for the chances of
his education and environment, the massive fact remains
that no other man of the same general education
and environment has ever created anything even
remotely comparable to it. Wagner deserved the
eminence that came to him quite as certainly as the
Lord God Jehovah deserves that which attaches to
Him. He got it by differing sharply from other men,
and enormously for the better, and by laboring colossally
and incessantly to make that difference visible.
At the other extreme lies such a fellow, say, as young
John D. Rockefeller. He is, by all ordinary standards,
an eminent man. When he says anything
the newspapers report it in full. If he fell ill of
gallstones to-morrow, or eloped with a lady Ph.D.,
or fell off the roof of his house, or was taken in a
rum raid the news would be telegraphed to all parts of
the earth and at least a billion human beings would
show some interest in it. And if he went to Washington
and pulled the White House bell he would be let in
infallibly, even if the Heir of Lincoln had to quit
a saxophone lesson to see him. But it must be obvious
that young John’s eminence, such as it is, is
almost purely fortuitous and unearned. He is attended
to simply because he happens to be the son
of old John, and hence heir to a large fortune. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
far as the records show, he has never said anything
in his life that was beyond the talents of a Rotary
Club orator or a newspaper editorial writer, or done
anything that would have strained an intelligent
bookkeeper. He is, to all intents and purposes, a
vacuum, and yet he is known to more people, and
especially to more people of means, than Wagner, and
admired and envied vastly more by all classes.</p>

<p>Between Wagner and young John there are infinite
gradations, and sometimes it is a hard matter to
distinguish between them. To most Americans, I
daresay, a Harding or a Coolidge appears to enjoy an
eminence that is not only more gaudy but also more
solid than that of, say, an Einstein. When Einstein
visited the United States, a few years ago, he was
taken to see Harding as a sort of treat, and many
worthy patriots, no doubt, regarded it as somewhat
too rich for him, an enemy alien and a Jew. If
Thomas Hardy came here to-morrow, his publisher
would undoubtedly try to get an invitation to the
White House for him, not merely to advertise his
books but also to honor the man. Yet it must be
plain that the eminence of Coolidge, however vastly
it may be whooped up by gentlemen of enlightened
self-interest, is actually greatly inferior to that of
either Einstein or Hardy. These men owe whatever
fame they have to actual accomplishments. There
is no doubt whatever that what they have is wholly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
theirs. They owe nothing to anyone, and no conceivable
series of accidents could have made them
what they are. If superiority exists among men,
then they are indubitably superior. But is there any
sign of superiority in Coolidge? I can find none.
His eminence is due entirely to two things: first, a
series of accidents, and secondly, the possession of
qualities that, in themselves, do not mark a superior
man, but an inferior. He is a cheap, sordid and
grasping politician, a seeker of jobs all his life, willing
to do almost anything imaginable to get them.
He has never said a word worth hearing, or done a
thing requiring genius, or even ordinary skill. Put
into his place and given the opportunities that have
arisen before him in a long succession, any other
ninth-rate lawyer in the land could have got as far as
he has got.</p>

<p>Now for my point. It is, in brief, that the public
estimation of eminence runs almost directly in inverse
ratio to its genuineness. That is to say, the sort of
eminence that the mob esteems most highly is precisely
the sort that has least grounding in solid worth
and honest accomplishment. And the reason therefor
is not far to seek. The kind of eminence that it
admires is simply the kind that it can understand—the
kind that it can aspire to. The very puerility
of a Coolidge, in fact, is one of the principal causes
of the admiration he excites. What he has done in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
the world is within the capacities, given luck enough,
of any John Smith. His merits, such as they are,
are almost universal, and hence perfectly comprehensible.
But what a Wagner or an Einstein does is
wholly beyond the understanding of an ordinary ignoramus,
and so it is impossible for the ignoramus
to admire it. Worse, it tends to arouse his suspicion,
and hence his animosity. He is not merely indifferent
to the merits of a Wagner; he will, if any attempt
is made to force them upon his attention, challenge
them sharply. What he admires fundamentally, in
other words, is himself, and in a Coolidge, a Harding,
a baseball pitcher, a movie actor, an archbishop, or
a bank president he can see himself. He can see
himself, too, though perhaps more dimly, in a Dewey,
a Pershing, a Rockefeller or a Jack Dempsey. But
he can no more see himself in a Wagner or an
Einstein than he can see himself on the throne of
the Romanoffs, and so he suspects and dislikes such
men, as he suspects and dislikes Romanoffs.</p>

<p>Unluckily, it is one thing to denounce his stupidity,
and quite another thing to escape its consequences.
The history of mankind is peopled chiefly, not with
the genuinely great men of the race, but with the
flashy and hollow fellows who appealed to the mob.
Every American remembers vividly the contribution
that Theodore Roosevelt made to the building of the
Panama Canal—a contribution that might have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
made by any other American thrown fortuitously into
his place, assuming only that the substitute shared his
normal American lack of a sense of honor. But who
remembers the name of the man who actually designed
the canal? I turn to the New International Encyclopedia
and find nine whole pages about the canal,
with many drawings. There is eloquent mention of
Col. Goethals—who simply carried out the designer’s
plans. There is mention, too, of Col. Gorgas—whose
sanitary work was a simple application of other men’s
ideas. There is ample space for Roosevelt, and his
blackjacking of Colombia. But so far as I can find,
the name of the designer is not there. The mob did
not admire him, and so history has overlooked him.</p>

<h3>5<br>

<i>An Historic Blunder</i></h3>

<p>The Southern gentry made a thumping mistake
when, after the Civil War, they disfranchised the
blacks. Had they permitted the latter to vote, they
would have retained political control of all the Southern
States, for the blacks, like the peasants everywhere
else, would have followed their natural masters. As
it was, control quickly passed to the poor white trash,
who still maintain it, though many of them have
ceased to be poor. The gentry struggle in vain to
get back in the saddle; they lack the votes to achieve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
the business unaided, and the blacks, who were ready
to follow them in 1870, are now incurably suspicious
of them. The result is that politics in the South remain
fathomlessly swinish. Every civilized Southerner
knows it and is ashamed of it, but the time has
apparently passed to do anything about it. To get
rid of its Bleases, Mayfields, Slemps, Peays and
Vardamans, the South must wait until the white trash
are themselves civilized. This is a matter demanding
almost as much patience as the long vigil of the
Seventh Day Adventists.</p>

<h3>6<br>

<i>On Cynicism</i></h3>

<p>One of the most curious of human delusions lies in
the theory that cynics are unhappy men—that cynicism
makes for a general biliousness and malaise.
It is a false deduction, I believe, from the obvious
fact that cynics make <i>other</i> men unhappy. But they
are themselves among the most comfortable and serene
of mammals; perhaps only bishops, pet dogs and
actors are happier. For what a cynic believes,
though it may be too dreadful to be put into formal
words, at least usually has the merit of being true—and
truth is ever a rock, hard and harsh, but solid
under the feet. A cynic is chronically in the position
of a wedding guest who has known the bride for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
nine years, and has had her confidence. He is a
great deal less happy, theoretically, than the bridegroom.
The bridegroom, beautifully barbered and
arrayed, is about to launch into the honeymoon. But
the cynic looks ahead two weeks, two months, two
years. Such, to borrow a phrase from the late Dr.
Eliot, are the durable satisfactions of life.</p>

<h3>7<br>

<i>Music and Sin</i></h3>

<p>Among Christian workers and other intellectual
cripples the delusion seems to persist that jazz is
highly aphrodisiacal. I never encounter a sermon on
the subject without finding it full of dark warnings to
parents, urging them to keep their nubile daughters
out of the jazz palaces on the ground that the voluptuous
music will inflame their passions and so make
them easy prey to bond salesmen, musicians and other
such carnal fellows. All this seems to me to be nonsense.
Jazz, in point of fact, is not voluptuous at all.
Its monotonous rhythm and puerile tunes make it a
sedative rather than a stimulant. If it is an aphrodisiac,
then the sound of riveting is also an aphrodisiac.
What fetches the flappers who come to
grief in the jazz parlors is not the music at all, but
the alcohol. Drinking it out of flasks in the washrooms,
they fail to keep the dose in harmony with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
their natural resistance, and so they lose control of
their faculties, and what follows is lamentable. Jazz,
which came in with Prohibition, gets the blame that
belongs to its partner. In the old days, when it was
uncommon for refined women to get drunk at dances,
it would have been quite harmless. To-day even
Chopin’s funeral march would be dangerous.</p>

<p>The truth is that jazz is probably the least voluptuous
variety of music commonly heard in Christendom.
There are plenty of Methodist hymns that
are ten times as aphrodisiacal, and the fact is proved
by the scandals that follow every camp-meeting. In
most parts of the United States, indeed, the Methodists
have begun to abandon camp-meetings as subversive
of morality. Where they still flourish it is
not unusual for even the rev. clergy to be taken
in byzantine practices. But so-called good music
is yet worse than the Methodist hymns. Has the
world so soon forgotten James Huneker’s story of
the prudent opera mamma who refused to let her
daughter sing Isolde, on the ground that no woman
could ever get through the second act without forgetting
God? That second act, even so, is much overestimated.
There are piano pieces of Chopin that are
a hundred times worse; if the Comstocks really had
any sense, they would forbid their performance.
And what of the late Puccini? If “La Bohème” is
not an aphrodisiac, then what is it? Yet it is sung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
publicly all over the world. Only in Atlanta, Ga.,
is there a law against it, and even that law was probably
inspired by the fact that it was written by a
Catholic and not by the fact that it has brought hundreds
of thousands of Christian women to the edge of
the abyss.</p>

<p>Old Ludwig himself was not without guilt. His
“Egmont” overture is a gross and undisguised appeal
to the medulla oblongata. And what of his symphonies
and quartettes? The last movement of his
Eroica is not only voluptuous to the last degree; it is
also Bolshevistic. Try to play it with your eyes on
a portrait of Dr. Coolidge. You will find the thing
as impossible as eating ice-cream on roast beef. At
the time of its first performance in Vienna the moral
sense of the community was so greatly outraged that
Beethoven had to get out of town for a while. I pass
over Wagner, whose “Tristan und Isolde” was probably
his most decorous work, despite Huneker—think
of “Parsifal”!—and come to Richard Strauss.
Here I need offer no argument: his “Salomé” and
“Elektra” have been prohibited by the police, at one
time or another, in nearly every country in the world.
I believe that “Der Rosenkavalier” is still worse,
though the police leave it unmolested. Compare its
first act to the most libidinous jazz ever heard of on
Broadway. It is like comparing vodka to ginger-pop.
No woman who hears it is ever the same again. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
may remain within the law, but her thoughts are wayward
henceforth. Into her ear the sirens have poured
their abominable song. She has been beset by
witches. There is a sinister glitter in her eye.</p>

<h3>8<br>

<i>The Champion</i></h3>

<p>Of the forty-eight sovereign States of this imperial
Federation, which is the worst? In what one of them
is a civilized man most uncomfortable? Over half
the votes, if the question were put to a vote, would
probably be divided between California and Tennessee.
Each in its way, is almost unspeakable. Tennessee,
of course, has never been civilized, save in a
small area; even in the earliest days of the Republic
it was regarded as barbaric by its neighbors. But
California, at one time, promised to develop a charming
and enlightened civilization. There was a touch
of tropical balm in its air, and a touch of Latin and
oriental color in its ideas. Like Louisiana, it seemed
likely to resist Americanization for many years; perhaps
forever. But now California, the old California,
is simply extinct. What remains is an Alsatia
of retired Ford agents and crazy fat women—a
paradise of 100% Americanism and the New
Thought. Its laws are the most extravagant and
idiotic ever heard of in Christendom. Its public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
officers, and particularly its judges, are famous all
over the world for their imbecilities. When one
hears of it at all, one hears that some citizen has been
jailed for reading the Constitution of the United States,
or that some new swami in a yellow bed-tick has got
all the realtors’ wives of Los Angeles by the ears.
When one hears of it further, it is only to learn that
some obscure movie lady in Hollywood has murdered
another lover. The State is run by its Chambers
of Commerce, which is to say, by the worst
variety of resident shysters. No civilized man ever
seems to take any part in its public life. Not an idea
comes out of it—that is, not an idea beyond the grasp
of a Kiwanis Club secretary, a Christian Science sorcerer,
or a grand goblin of the American Legion.
Twice, of late, it has offered the country candidates
for the presidency. One was the Hon. Hiram Johnson
and the other was the Hon. William Gibbs McAdoo!
Only Vermont can beat that record.</p>

<p>The minority of civilized Californians—who lately,
by the way, sent out a call from Los Angeles for
succor, as if they were beset by wolves!—commonly
lay the blame for this degeneration of a once-proud
commonwealth upon the horde of morons that has
flowed in from Iowa, Nebraska and the other cow-States,
seeking relief from the bitter climate of the
steppes. The California realtors have been luring
in these hinds for a generation past, and they now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
swarm in all the southern towns, especially Los Angeles.
They come in with their savings, are swindled
and sent home, and so make room for more. While
they remain and have any part of their money left,
they patronize the swamis, buy oil stock, gape at the
movie folk, and pack the Methodist churches. Unquestionably,
the influence of such vacuums has
tended to degrade the general tone of California life;
what was once a Spanish <i>fiesta</i> is now merely an upper
Mississippi valley street-carnival. But it is not to be
forgotten that the Native Sons have gone down the
chute with the newcomers—that there is no more sign
of intellectual vigor in the old stock than there is in
the new stock. A few intransigeants hold out against
the tide of 100% Americanism, but only a few.
The rest bawl against the Reds as loudly as any Iowa
steer-stuffer.</p>

<p>The truth is that it is unjust to blame Iowa for the
decay of California, for Iowa itself is now moving
up, not down. And so is Nebraska. A few years
ago both States were as sterile, intellectually, as
Spain, but both are showing signs of progress to-day,
and in another generation or two, as the Prohibition
lunacy passes and the pall of Methodism begins to
lift, they will probably burst into very vigorous
activity. Some excellent stock is in them; it is very
little contaminated by what is called Anglo-Saxon
blood. Iowa, even to-day, is decidedly more civilized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
than California. It is producing more ideas,
and, more important still, it is carrying on a much
less violent war <i>against</i> ideas. I doubt that any man
who read the Constitution in Davenport or Des Moines
would be jailed for it, as Upton Sinclair (or one of
his friends) was in Pasadena. The American Legion
would undoubtedly protest, but the police would
probably do nothing, for the learned judges of the
State would not entertain the charge.</p>

<p>Thus California remains something of a mystery.
The whole United States, of course, has been going
downhill since the beginning of the century, but why
should one State go so much faster than the others?
Is the climate to blame? Hardly. The climate of
San Francisco is thoroughly un-Californian, and yet
San Francisco is almost as dead as Los Angeles. It
was there, indeed, that that California masterpiece,
the Mooney case, was staged; it was here that the cops
made three efforts to convict poor Fatty Arbuckle of
murder in the first-degree; it was there that the late
Dr. Abrams launched a quackery that went Mother
Eddy one better. San Francisco, once the home of
Mark Twain and Bret Harte, is now ravaged by Prohibition
enforcement officers. But if the climate is
not to blame, then what is? Why should a great
State, lovely physically and of romantic history, so
violently renounce all sense and decency? What has
got into it? God alone knows!</p>

<i>Honor in America</i></h3>

<p>Some time ago I enjoyed the distinguished honor
of entertaining an American university professor in
my house. The fellow had a resilient gullet, and in
the course of the evening we got down a quart of
Scotch. Made expansive by the liquor, he told me
this story:</p>

<p>A short while before, at his university, one of the
professors gave a booze party for a group of colleagues,
including the president of the institution. It
was warm weather, and they sat on the veranda,
guzzling moonshine and ginger-ale. There was so
much chatter that they didn’t hear a student coming
up the path. Suddenly he was on them, and they
almost fainted....</p>

<p>At this point I asked why they were alarmed.</p>

<p>“Well,” said my visitor, “suppose the student had
turned out to be a Christian? He would have
blabbed, and then our host would have lost his chair.
The president would have been forced to cashier him.”</p>

<p>“But the president,” I argued, “was a guest in the
man’s house. How could he have dismissed him?”</p>

<p>“What else would there have been for him to do?”
asked the professor.</p>

<p>“Resign at once,” I replied. “Wasn’t he under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
obligations of a guest? Wasn’t he <i>particeps criminis</i>?
How could he separate himself from his host? How
could he sit as judge upon his host, even if only
formally?”</p>

<p>But the professor couldn’t see the point. I began
to fear that he was in his cups, but it soon appeared
that he was quite clear. We argued for half an hour:
he was still unable to see the point. The duty of a
president to enforce an unwilling and dishonest
obedience to an absurd law—this duty was superior
to his duty as a guest, <i>i. e.</i>, it was superior to his obligation
as a man of honor! We passed on to another
point.</p>

<p>“What of the student?” I asked. “I take it that
he turned out to be a gentleman. Suppose he had
been a Christian? Suppose he had blabbed? What
would the other boys have done to him?”</p>

<p>The professor stared at me blankly.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” he said at length. “After all, we <i>were</i>
boozing.”</p>

<p>This professor, I should add, was a man of the old
American stock—in fact, a fellow very proud of his
colonial ancestry. When he got back to his university
he joined in signing a public statement that Prohibition
was a great success there.</p>

<p>I proceed to another case. One day in the Summer
of 1924, during the Republican National Convention
at Cleveland, I met an eminent American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
publicist in a hotel lobby there. He told me at once
that he was suffering from a dreadful bellyache.
I had a jug in my room, but my own hotel was far
away, so I suggested that help might be got from a
journalist on the premises. We went to his room,
and I introduced the publicist. The journalist
promptly got out a bottle and gave him a policeman’s
drink. The publicist had recovered in three minutes....
When he got home, he joined, like the professor,
in signing a public statement praising Prohibition.</p>
